KHULNA  First it was Hamilton Masakadza  who scored a record breaking 93 to help Zimbabwe post a formidable total  Then came Tendai Chisoro's three wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2 2 with an 18 run win in Khulna While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan  and Mahmudullah  Neville Madziva  the pacer  did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board  Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going  But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14 ball 18 in the seventh over Mahmudullah  meanwhile  rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips  but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long off  Along the way  he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13 Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6 3 overs as the scales started to tilt again  But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul  who was caught at cover  Mashrafe Mortaza  who has shown ability to wield the long handle  struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer  Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe  But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro  Abu Hider Rony swung his way around  but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts  He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket  but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80 run stand  Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes  using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck  He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil  Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25 ball 32  Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18 ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base On the night  the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month  The jewel in Zimbabwe's twin wins to cap off their tour was Masakadza  whose 222 runs is a world record for most runs in aT20 bilateral series

Johanna Konta marches on in the Australian Open  her excellent game buttressed by that weird  metronomic serve and embellished by a high powered cross court forehand that was too much for Denisa Allertova on Hisense Arena on Saturday The British No1 closed out an impressive 6 2  6 2 win to advance to the fourth round  and she now has realistic chances of going deep into the second week after a string of seeds went out in the first five days of the tournament Allertova extended her as far as she could  but could not resist the precision of Kontas serve  and the job was done when Konta slammed another neat forehand to her feet  forcing a final error after 64 minutes From here  it gets a little harder  Konta will meet the Russian No21 seed  Ekaterina Makarova  after she eliminated No9 seed Karolina Pliskova On this showing and her earlier efforts  Konta is now a serious danger to the higher seeds in her first Australian Open  To reach the last eight would be an extraordinary effort; she would be the first British player to make the quarter finals of a slam since Jo Durie at Wimbledon in 1984

West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has officially retired from international cricket  seven months after selectors opted to discard the veteran and push for a youth oriented policy Chanderpaul  who was dumped before the home series against Australia last June  said at the time he felt he deserved the opportunity to play one final series despite a poor return in domestic cricket before the squad was selected The West Indies Cricket Board  WICB  thanked him for his contribution to their game  The WICB acknowledges the invaluable contribution Shiv has made to the game globally and we wish him all the best   WICB President Dave Cameron said in a statement The 41 year old made his test debut against England in 1994 and went on to amass 11 867 runs at an average of 51 37 in his 164 tests for the Caribbean side His total is the seventh highest of all time  and he finished behind Brian Laras 11 953 as the second most prolific West Indian batsman He scored 30 test centuries and 66 half centuries and had a high score of 203 not out He also scored 8 778 runs in 268 one day internationals at 41 60 Chanderpauls ungainly batting stance was at odds with crickets coaching manuals  but soft hands and a superb eye allowed him to flick  dab and poke the ball into gaps in the field and quietly accumulate runs A low conversion rate of 50s to 100s early in his career was rectified after foot surgery removed some floating bone chips and allowed him to play without pain Chanderpauls calm demeanour held together an increasingly brittle West Indies batting lineup after the retirement of Lara and many opposition teams targeted him as the key wicket While selectors continue to pursue their youth policy in a bid to rebuild the once powerful cricketing side  Chanderpaul was still playing domestic first class cricket earlier this week
