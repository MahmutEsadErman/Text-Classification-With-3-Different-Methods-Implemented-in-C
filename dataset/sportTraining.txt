Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2 0 lead in the three match series That position  and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG  have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday  1030 GMT  For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend A 3 0 sweep  meanwhile  would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four match series Off spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line up That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury  leaving his place in the team in jeopardy OKeefes inclusion for his second test    his first on home soil    would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006 Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4 61 in Melbourne While Darren Bravo  Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne  the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series  West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left arm orthodox Jomel Warrican 
After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015  Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year    restoring his country to the top of the test rankings Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player The 26 year old scored a remarkable 2 369 runs across all three formats  rattling up 1 474 in tests alone at an average of 73 70 with six centuries He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50 over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India  New Zealand and West Indies Even in the Ashes defeat to England  the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year  he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords Even before he was captain  though  Smith was always clear that team success came first With Australia already 2 0 up in the three match series  this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa  Its a huge motivation  thats what we want to be  number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there   Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  on Saturday  It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3 0  Its been a good summer for us so far  so wed like to finish on a high  Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start  Februarys two test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance Australia beat the Black Caps 2 0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side  like many of the top test teams  have struggled to win series overseas in recent years  Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment  I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on   Smith added  Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand  but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are  hopefully we can have a lot of success over there  Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed  I felt pretty good last week  I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again   Smith said  All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed  Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good  so hopefully I can score a few more this week 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited overs matches in New Zealand this month Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing He also served three months of a six month prison term His ban  imposed by the International Cricket Council  ICC   has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program  McCullum said If he gets out on the field against us  then you play against the man you're playing against  not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster  added the explosive batsman New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation He was a very  very young man  a boy really  when he was suspended   White said He showed remorse at the time  admitted to it  He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing  added White New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received A decision is likely next week

Australias spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground  where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start Denesh Ramdin  unbeaten on 23  and Carlos Brathwaite  35 not out  will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and OKeefe got plenty of turn off a straw coloured wicket Off spinner Lyon  2 68  produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwoods off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85 Left arm orthodox spinner OKeefe  1 42  then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil Trailing 2 0 in the three match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne  West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test After the early loss of opener Shai Hope  nine   Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo  33  looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one Australias bowlers emerged from the break re energised  however  and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravos miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep That broke a 91 run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20 run mark He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble  left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps After a long glare at his partner  Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half century just before lunch by clipping all rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced  He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the openers glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip   Reuters

Back to back one day defeats in Perth and Brisbane have forced India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to rethink his strategy of opting to bat first against Australia  who have taken a 2 0 lead in the five match series by chasing down 300 plus targets Dhoni won the toss in both matches and after India posted scores of 309 and 308 and watched as the hosts reeled them in with powerful displays at the crease There was also a suggestion of a lack of discipline about Indias bowlers  who leaked 23 wides in the two matches Ahead of Sundays third one dayer  Dhoni wondered if chasing a target was a better option for India  I feel even if we cut down the extras we will have to score more runs   said Dhoni  There are two options  either put pressure on the batsmen and score 330  or chase down the score  give them the batting first We will have a look and decide what suits us the best  While Rohit Sharma burnished his reputation in limited overs cricket with a second successive century in Brisbane  skipper Dhoni said he was seeking even more his batsmen  As a team we have to win  irrespective of which department is not doing well  and for that we have to score 20 30 more runs   he added  That will put a lot of pressure on the batsmen  because the moment you take your guard right from the first ball  on the back of your mind would be we have to get 330 340 odd runs to be on the safer side and that would put a lot of pressure 
KHULNA  Sabbir Rehman gave an account of his all round abilities in Bangladesh's 42 run win over Zimbabwe in the second T20 in Khulna  He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza  one of his three scalps  as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168 run chase in the ninth over Soumya Sarkar also made 43  but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over  Yet  Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries   they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings  Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half  until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2 0 lead in the four match series Bangladesh started well  but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over  But just as he started to rev up his engine  he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir  But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43 Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah  who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami  Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well  even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20 ball 24 before hobbling off the field  Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs Masakadza came out all guns blazing  hitting two fours and two sixes in 2 2 overs  while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act  Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza  First  the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover  before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17  It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball  and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long on for a 28 ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes  Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs  Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami  who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th  14th and 15th over  but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners  Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21 ball 29 by Al Amin Hossain in the 16th over Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe  The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir  who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20 With a series win out of the equation  Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20

Big financial incentives for gamblers  small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one on one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match fixers  according to experts and industry insiders Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match fixing  just as the Australian Open  the first grand slam tournament of the year  kicked off in Melbourne Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport  where  out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world  the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents  said Steve Georgakis  a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney  who is researching match fixing in tennis  If you have a look at the big tournaments  the Opens or Olympic Games  youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins   he said But at a small tournament the following week  how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured  said Georgakis A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player  handing a big payoff to those behind the fix  Its a one on one sport and what you do is  youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match And you can never get caught   Georgakis added Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites  and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually  Patrick Jay  an independent betting expert  told the United Nations in 2015 In that sea of money  tennis is the second most active betting market  trailing only soccer  research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs  a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point by point or game by game with limits on those types of bets  pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match  Say you want to throw a game but win the match  why would you bother  You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars   the gambler said Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit  which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act  Most money is won by betting on the favourite  which is not a good result for bookmakers   he added  But if hes up one set to love and then  in play  people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot  most likely  to say  to the authorities  is there anything you need for us to look into    the bookmaker said

Stephen Cook became the 100th batsman to score a debut Test century and his innings of 115 helped South Africa amass 329 for five on the first day of the final Test against England on Friday in their bid to salvage pride in a lost series Hashim Amla scored his 25th Test century as he and Cook shared a second wicket stand of 202 but captain AB de Villiers departed second ball on a day of contrasting fortunes as England  2 0 up in the four Test series  fought back to claim four wickets after tea Temba Bavuma  32  and Quinton de Kock  25  were not out at the close of play at Centurion Park Handed his debut at the age of 33  one of five South Africa changes from the team badly beaten in the third Test in Johannesburg last week  Cook brought his domestic form to the test arena with a dream start to his international career He survived two dropped catches  two close run out calls and an lbw appeal unsuccessfully reviewed by England before reaching three figures    a nervous spell in the 90s exacerbated by the departures of Amla and De Villiers But Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball on his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  looked organised from the start  hitting a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side He should have been out on 47 but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broads bowling  He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes Amla  who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting  looked effortless as he raced to three figures  scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes De Villiers  captain for his second Test  was out for his second duck in successive innings  caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series JP Duminy was Moeen Alis second wicket  trapped lbw for 16    the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africas progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one   Reuters 
Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century and Stephen Cook was 91 not out to lead South Africa to 224 for one at tea on the first day of the final Test against England as the hosts bid to salvage pride in a lost series Amlas 25th Test century came off 131 balls in a confident display which brought him 18 fours while Cook was nine runs short of a debut Test century at Centurion Park on Friday Amla  who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting  looked effortless as he raced to three figures to cheers South Africa who lost two of the first three Tests and the series He was 102 not out at the interval Cook  handed his debut at the age of 33 in one of five South Africa changes after defeat in Johannesburg last week  offered a straightforward chance after lunch when he got a healthy edge to a Stuart Broad delivery but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow on 47 There was another more difficult opportunity for Bairstow down the leg side when Cook was on 76  But Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf  allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali  hitting with some power  and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor  thriving in the most dangerous position on the field South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg side or pitched too short   Reuters 
Dean Elgar fell to a freak catch but debutant Stephen Cook remained unbeaten on 46 to help South Africa reach 107 for one at lunch on the opening day of the fourth and final Test against England at Centurion Park on Friday Hashim Amla was batting on 34 at the break  having added 72 runs with Cook for the flourishing second wicket partnership after Elgar was dismissed for 20 James Taylor  at short leg  showed good anticipation and presence of mind when Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf  allowing him to pluck it before it could drop on the ground Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review by the television umpire It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor  thriving in the most dangerous position on the field Cook began his Test career hitting four off the first ball of the game as James Andersons opening delivery strayed down leg side It set the tone for the opening session with England being inconsistent with their bowling line  often drifting down the leg side and erring in length on the short side The 33 year old Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he debuted for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  was one of five changes from the third Test made by the home team South Africa captain AB de Villiers won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket expected to provide for ideal batting on the opening day England  who have taken an unassailable 2 0 lead in the series  made just one change to their team with seamer Chris Woakes  who played in the first Test  coming in for the injured Steven Finn   Reuters
