Milans Expo      opened on Friday with hopes the six month food themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italys deep seated problems The first global exhibition since Shanghais groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at      GMT Corruption scandals  fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run up to the event But Italy is a master at delivering at the   th hour    the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the      World Cup came within minutes of kick off And a spectacular eve of opening concert  featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli  Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the citys renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milans magnificent Gothic cathedral  was a reminder of the countrys capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night  facing down the opponents who say a state with Italys unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is  by definition  ephemeral in nature Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening  when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower  an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo   Milan seeking reinvention  Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago  long before Renzi came to power last year  But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership The event plays to Italys strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy based theme of  Feeding the Planet  Energy for Life  Organisers are predicting    million visitors over six months and a    billion euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other  harder to measure  benefits such as increased investment More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes For Milan  the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a   st Century  smart  city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy  design and sustainable living as by its industrial past There will be tight airport style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the  No Expo  movements march Earlier this week  police carried out pre emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces Officers seized fireworks  baseball bats  gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails The organisers of Fridays demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo The Expos critics have focused on the conditions of some of the       employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis  as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola  saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility 
Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won    cents to        a barrel Brent North Sea crude for June won    cents to stand at        a barrel in London midday deals After slumping at the start of the year  oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen  the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation  analysts said However  prices remain well down after plunging almost    percent between June and the start of      on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production  Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on    prices since June last year   Kash Kamal  senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending  including subsidies  and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices The wealthy monarchies  however  should  not react in a knee jerk way to lower oil prices   the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday  Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over    million barrels per day in April   said Kamal  Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar   he added A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies  boosting demand   AFP 
Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending  including subsidies  and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices  the International Monetary Fund said The wealthy monarchies  however  should  not react in a knee jerk way to lower oil prices   the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday They would be better off to  adjust gradually  using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts  he said in Dubai  But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels   it is important that they gradually  but in a determined way    reduce their spending  and  consolidate their fiscal position   Ahmed said Oil prices have shed half of their value since June       and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain  Kuwait  Oman  Qatar  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates    economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues  A combined budget surplus for      of     billion       billion euros  is expected to turn into a deficit of      billion this year  the IMF said in its latest regional report   They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil   said Ahmed  pointing out that many have already taken such measures  The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification  The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area     Curb subsidies  GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour  Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices    We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them   Ahmed said Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector  which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners In addition  GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that  most advance the development agenda   said Ahmed Oil export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be      billion lower this year than a year ago With the exception of gas rich Qatar and Kuwait  all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year  said Ahmed  adding this could persist for two or three years  The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years   he said This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices  GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about      trillion  The impact on  economic  growth is quite limited   said Ahmed The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at     percent in       one percent down from earlier predictions  mainly because of a slowdown in non oil growth in response to lower oil prices

China s tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday  as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of  panic sentiment  gripping investors Beijing  which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will  unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell off  and the People s Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares The CSI    index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down     percent  while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped     percent With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a buyer  blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the week bore the brunt  I ve never seen this kind of slump before  I don t think anyone has  Liquidity is totally depleted   said Du Changchun  an analyst at Northeast Securities  Originally  many wanted to hold blue chips  But since so many small caps are suspended from trading  the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips  More than    percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid June  and for some global investors the fear that China s market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece  Also  the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up   wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note   We expect slower growth  poorer corporate earnings  and a higher risk of a financial crisis  Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world s second largest economy  with copper prices falling to a six year low  Shanghai nickel futures sliding by their   percent daily limit  and oil falling towards     a barrel  near a three month low TRADING HALTSMore than     China listed firms announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday  taking total suspensions to about            percent of the market or roughly      trillion worth of stock   as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage With so many small cap companies sheltering on the sidelines  the ChiNext growth board  which has seen some of the biggest swings in valuations  fell a modest     percent The plunge in China s previously booming stock markets  which had more than doubled in the year to mid June  is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China s top leaders  who are already grappling with slowing growth Beijing s interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars  worth of stocks  helped by a state backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided     billion yuan        billion  to    brokerages  though that sum is only    percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since June    RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets  which are dominated by professional money managers  retail investors account for around    percent of China trade  which exacerbates volatility  It s uncommon to see so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls  and the index futures swinging so wildly   said Wang Feng  CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader  It s a stampede  And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction  and are too emotional  A surprise interest rate cut by the central bank at the end of June  relaxations in margin trading and other  stability measures  have done little to calm investors The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday s trading session  without visible effect Deng Ge  a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission  said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo  China s version of Twitter  that there had been a big increase in  irrational selling  of stocks Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares But the market sell off has extended beyond the mainland  with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as     percent on Tuesday  according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities Hong Kong s Hang Seng Index fell     percent  with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating  Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service  and you can see that in their share prices   said Matthew Smith  a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie

The Federal Board of Revenue  FBR  has initiated a drive to identify income sources of luxurious vehicles owners to ensure their tax return filings  confiscating vehicles on non compliance  official sources said on Thursday The sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above      cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department We are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities  said a source The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around     vehicles have been seized on non compliance Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of         registered vehicles above       CC  while Indus Motors Co Limited  Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of                 and        vehicles  respectively The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years  including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in      They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used  especially in rural areas An official at Regional Tax Office  RTO  Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible The customs cleared around        vehicles under the amnesty scheme      and earned the FBR Rs     billion as duty and taxes The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income  said the source However  the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct The Federal Tax Ombudsman  in       released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling  emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy  the report said It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class  adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles  the amnesty scheme      was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs  the report said Besides  many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles  it said It will be difficult to cross match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario  said a source in the Inland Revenue

The government believes that coal based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority  NEPRA  said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects  coal power plants are considered the best option in the short  and medium term planning  reads a Nepras decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for     megawatt coal based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately      million The project is expected to be commissioned by December           while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi annual basis  confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country  The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development  the authority said In short  the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe  secure  reliable and cheaper supply of electricity The authority said for sustainable development  all types of electric power generation resources  including coal  imported indigenous   hydel  wind  solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country  affecting the macro and microeconomic stability  read the ruling An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand supply gap and to achieve sustainable development

Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies  Discos  by up to      percent from       percent in      in the power tariff  inflicting a loss of Rs    billion per annum  reveals the governments official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF  a copy of which is available with The News Under the circular debt management plan  the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs    billion  as of end of June       to Rs    billion by financial year ending June          while keeping within the target of     percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector  about Rs    billion  and   percent fiscal deficit  At the end of each month  the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs    billion  The circular debt management plan  or capping mechanism  will include reducing the increase of circular debt  flow  as well as the stock  outstanding amount   Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited  PHCL  debt will be reduced from Rs    billion to Rs    billion by       Collection from government customers will be rationalized  and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule  Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs  trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system  it accounts for Rs   billion  This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs    billion in the tariff just under the head of losses  However  Nepra  which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses  has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to      percent from       percent  Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to      percent in the tariff from       percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs    billion  saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs  billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff  Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for         at       percent compared to      percent  The     percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs     billion in financial year       Now the regulator for financial year      allowed      percent compared with expected losses of       percent  narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses  but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs   billion due to increase in generation  In the short term  there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined  Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives  to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year      determinations  For the purposes of this circular debt management plan  it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs   billion to Rs   billion  The privatization programme  according to the document  is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized  With expected privatization of three Discos in FY       multi year tariff  MYT  will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks  in any event  the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner  For the Discos not privatized  the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service

The world will store unwanted oil for most of      as declines in U S  output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output  the International Energy Agency said The agency  which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries  said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as     per barrel  it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels The Paris based IEA trimmed its forecast for      oil demand growth  which now stands at      million barrels per day  bpd  following a five year high of     million in      It cut its call on OPEC crude for      by         bpd to      million bpd  That figure is much lower than OPEC s January output of       million bpd  Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that  speculation  It is OPEC s business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low   the IEA said Oil prices collapsed over the past    months to below     a barrel from as high as      as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher cost producers such as U S  shale companies out of the market Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced  As a result  unwanted oil went into storage  leading to record global stockpiles of over   billion barrels U S  shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in      when demand finally meets supply But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of      and added it saw non OPEC output falling by just     million bpd in       The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall off in production from U S  shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen  Perhaps resilience still has some way to go   the IEA said The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe haven status  meaning more downward pressure on oil prices With weaker global oil demand  likely new gains in Iraqi  Iranian and Saudi output  low chances of an OPEC deal  resilient U S  production and a strong dollar   the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen It said that even if OPEC production remained flat  global stocks would build by   million bpd in the first quarter  followed by a     million bpd build in the second quarter  Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building  this time by     million bpd  If these numbers prove to be accurate  and with the market already awash in oil  it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term  In these conditions the short term risk to the downside has increased

SINGAPORE Oil prices tumbled   percent early on Monday after a meeting by major producers in Qatar fell apart the day before  leaving the world awash with unwanted fuel International benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at        per barrel at      GMT  down     percent since their last settlement US crude futures were down     percent at        a barrel Some    oil exporting nations  including non OPEC Russia  had gathered in the Qatari capital of Doha for what was expected to be the rubber stamping of a deal to stabilise output at January levels until October      But the deal fell apart after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in despite calls on Riyadh to save the agreement and help prop up crude prices  The failure is negative from the psychological point of view  It shows the inability of all sides to cooperate   said Gary Ross  the founder and executive chairman at New York based consultancy PIRA The development will revive industry fears that major producers are embarking again on a battle for market share in a world already awash with unwanted oil  especially after Riyadh threatened to raise output steeply if no freeze deal were reached As a result Brent would likely average     per barrel during the second quarter of this year as a global glut continued unabated  it said  This meeting and its outcome should have built confidence that the oil market rebalancing was close at hand  as well as building a circle of trust among producers for possible future cooperation and coordinated action  In this regard  the meeting was a complete failure   Barclays added  The failure of the talks gives the market another clear indication  similar to the failed December      OPEC meeting  that OPEC s relevance in this market environment has faded  and its ability to coordinate with members outside the group is equally difficult  Oil prices have fallen by as much as    percent since mid      as producers have pumped   to   million barrels of crude every day in excess of demand  leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel Beyond the failed deal  however  there were signs of a tightening market due to an oil worker strike in Kuwait which may have cut its production from      million barrels per day  bpd  to just     million bpd In the United States  oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday that drillers had cut their rigs to fresh      lows as the industry suffers from low prices

Pakistan is wooing foreign car makers like Renault and Nissan with generous import duties  but convincing them to set up factories will be an uphill challenge given fears about the country s long term political stability and security Pakistan wants to shake up its Japanese dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota  Honda  and Suzuki  whose locally assembled cars are sold at relatively high prices but lag behind imported vehicles in terms of quality and specifications To do that  analysts say  the government must convince manufacturers that the country has turned a corner after a decade of economic turbulence and a series of major attacks by militant groups including the Taliban With the economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years  the local currency stable against the dollar and interest rates at their lowest in    years  Pakistani officials believe the country is once again on the radar of investors seeking to tap into a market of nearly     million people Officials are touting a new auto policy  skewed in favour of new entrants  that includes offering foreign car manufacturers lower duties as an incentive to set up plants in Pakistan or revive shuttered ones  We expect that there will be one or two foreign investors coming into Pakistan   said Miftah Ismail  chairman of Pakistan s Board of Investment  who has been talking to car makers about setting up assembly plants for the local market Ismail told Reuters he had held talks with Japan s Nissan and France s Renault for  some time   and last month met Fiat executives in Italy for the first time Previous discussions also involved Germany s Volkswagen  I hope some people will bite   he said A source close to Renault said Pakistan was under consideration for new production investment  along with other potential locations  but added that discussions were at a very early stage  In an e mailed statement  the company said it had  no news to announce at this time  Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said   Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present   but added no final decision had been made STABILITYAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalising deals  despite the concessions on offer A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability The threat of militant attacks also remains high  despite the armed forces  long running campaign against groups including the Taliban Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long term outlook is so uncertain  There is potential in Pakistan  There is no doubt about that   said Puneet Gupta  associate director at consultant IHS Automotive    But  we really don t feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition  from a mid to long term perspective  Another potential turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan s car market  where         cars were sold in the           fiscal year  That compares with more than   million passenger vehicles a year in neighbouring India  The Pakistan market is not big enough   said Mumshad Ali  chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts He added that the government s new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers  nor did they address ways to increase demand  such as lowering sales taxes The local manufacturing partners of Suzuki  Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment But Ali said they felt aggrieved that the government was favouring new investors and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing factories Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free  Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at    percent  while existing players will have to pay    percent  We want greater competition  and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices   he said Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars  which tend not to have airbags  anti lock breaking systems  ABS  and other features considered standard elsewhere The cheapest Pakistani car  the Suzuki Mehran  sells for         Pakistani rupee           or about double the price of a comparable model in India  Local cars are so bad   said Ali Paracha  owner of a car rental company   The market has been in need of an overhaul for at least a decade or two

The inefficiency of the city administration has exposed again as a group of fresh milk sellers has illegally raised the rates of fresh milk by Rs per liter  selling it at Rs  per litre in some localities Majority of citizens are compelled to buy this fresh milk because the rate of tetra packed fresh milk is very high which needs urgent rationalization In fact the sellers of tetra packed  fresh milk have made a monopoly due to weak and non working anti monopoly laws in Karachi and sheer disregard to consumer rights in city administration circles The consumers demand a steep cut in the price of tetra packed fresh milk and equalizing it with the unpacked fresh milk being sold at local milk shops This long awaited step would not only provide some relief to consumers frustrate the bullying of dairy farmers and retail milk sellers but also increase the profit of the sellers of tetra packed milk in shape of increased sales The government needs to break the hegemony of tetra packed milk sellers and rationalize the prices of their commodities in the larger public interest

Indias gold imports could hit a record high this year amid widespread smuggling to sidestep government levies on overseas shipments  Australia and New Zealand Bank  Asias biggest shipper of physical gold  said on Wednesday The forecast by the banks head of precious metals  John Levin  runs counter to tallies that show gold imports in decline in the worlds second biggest gold market after China Levin said he expects    percent of Indias gold this year to be  smuggled in  or arrive via  other unofficial channels  to beat a    percent levy imposed by the government Levin also said more semi refined gold  known as gold dore  was being imported from overseas mining companies because of a lower government levy The import duty on gold dore is     percent  You could see a record amount of gold going into India this year   Levin said   A lot through unofficial channels and a lot of it going in as semi refined gold  However  industry officials say unofficial imports are also coming down as Indian market prices trade at a discount to the U S  dollar spot price As recently as a few weeks ago  Indian importers were offering discounts as high as     per ounce  or nearly   percent of the value to attract buyers This has been discouraging smugglers as their margins have been squeezed  Daman Prakash Rathod  a director at MNC Bullion  a wholesaler in the southern Indian city of Chennai  said on Wednesday Officially  Indias gold imports in the         fiscal year that ended on March    dropped    percent from a year ago to     tonnes ANZ last year handled about    percent of the worlds gold shipments  according to Levin 
The world is getting an object lesson on the problems of having one dominant global currency and even the supposed prime beneficiary  the United States  can see the downside Alarming bouts of volatility in world financial markets over the past    months have been rooted in a fear of what happens when a world with its highest ever peacetime debt pile faces even a hint of higher interest rates Despite a constant narrative about U S  households and banks paying down debts ever since the global credit crash eight years ago  any  deleveraging  that did happen was more than offset by higher government  corporate and personal debt around the globe in Europe  China and across emerging markets In fact  aggregate world debt is now far higher than it was before the         crash  The saga of debt is far from over   says a report from Morgan Stanley  It goes on to explain why Morgan Stanley expects demographic led shifts in savings and investment to soon push interest rates higher and transform that debt mountain into additional deadweight on world growth over next five years But the role of the U S  dollar as the world s main reserve currency denominating large chunks of that debt pile is showing up as complicating factor that s added to risk of instability The first U S  interest rate increase in almost a decade in December   just a quarter of a percentage point   was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since World War Two Underlining  cause and effect   the subsequent recovery only came about once the Federal Reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance Few doubt a growing U S  economy that s near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero  and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that But the rest of the world clearly can t The Bank for International Settlements estimates that while U S  dollar dominance means it accounts for almost    percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some    percent of hard currency reserves  But crucially it also accounts for about    percent of all debts and assets outside the United States And if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts  the boomerang effect on U S  exporters  commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the Fed s hands in ways made crystal clear this year already AMBIVALENCENo surprise  then  the U S  central bank has no deep love for the dollar s prime reserve currency status   even though it s been described by Europeans and others over the years as an  exorbitant privilege  that ensures the world lends to the U S  Treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength Speaking at an event in Zurich on Tuesday on the dollar s global status  New York Fed chief Bill Dudley said Americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or China s yuan eventually eat into the dollar s share of reserves  If other countries  currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies  it is not obvious to me that the United States loses   he said  as long as it  is being driven by their progress  rather than by the U S  doing a poorer job  While that s far from wishing away dollar hegemony  it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs   given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy It s that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere If the Fed can t adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar  then there s understandable concern that artificially low Fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that s supposed to play anchor At the same event in Zurich  Claudio Borio  head of the monetary and economic Department of the BIS  said the dollar s role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the United States to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits   and to run looser monetary policy for longer What s more  a resulting Fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons  Borio added  Easing begets easing   he said For Morgan Stanley  this is just leads to ever higher debt  and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years   only a series of  less painful  options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual In the meantime  the U S  bank said  the dollar itself will most likely push higher again  if only because the U S  economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment For Borio  a more  pluralistic  system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn t by itself solve any problem  either  There would then be no credible single anchor Hard headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer  This means not just putting one s house in order  but also putting our global village in order  
Brent jumped   percent on Tuesday while US crude settled up more than   percent  after a late burst of buying driven in part by expectations that record US crude inventories would not swell by as much as they have in recent weeks Crude supply outages in Canada  Nigeria and elsewhere also boosted prices  Brent s gain was its biggest one day percentage move in a month The market pared gains briefly in post settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute  API   an industry group  said U S  crude inventories rose by      million barrels to record highs of       million during the week ended May   Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a build of only         barrels Traders and investors will be looking out for official inventory data on Wednesday from the U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA   We should roll back a good part of today s gains if the EIA confirms the builds cited by API or comes up with even larger numbers   said Tariq Zahir  crude trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York Brent LCOc  settled up        or     percent  at        per barrel  More than       contracts changed hands in the final minute  Reuters data showed  The global oil benchmark rose to as high as        in post settlement trading  After settlement  it briefly dipped more than    cents on the API data  then recovered to near its settlement price U S  crude s West Texas Intermediate  WTI  futures CLc  rose       or     percent  to settle at         WTI also fell briefly on the API data Refined oil products joined the rally  with gasoline RBc  closing up   percent and ultralow sulphur diesel HOc   or heating oil    percent Oil prices were up most of the day on worries about supply outages Wildfires in Canada have shut in more than   million barrels per day of production from Alberta s oil sands region  Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the first to resume production in the area on Tuesday while others looked to restart after more than a week of halted operations In Nigeria  attacks on oil infrastructure have pushed crude output close to a    year low in Africa s largest oil producer  Reuters data showed This year s rebound in oil has been one of the strongest since the financial crisis  Prices have rallied nearly    percent from multiyear lows under     in the first quarter  supported by falling U S  production  supply constraints in Libya and the Americas and a weak dollar Since the end of April  the rally has stalled at around     
Internal differences are killing OPEC and its ability to influence the markets has all but evaporated  top Russian oil executive Igor Sechin told Reuters in some of his harshest remarks ever about the oil cartel Russia  which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse  was flirting with the idea of cooperating with OPEC in recent months until tensions between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran ruined a global deal to freeze output Sechin   one of the closest allies of President Vladimir Putin   was the only Russian official to consistently oppose the deal with OPEC even after the Kremlin effectively endorsed the plan Now that his gloomy predictions about talking to OPEC have come to pass  Sechin feels vindicated and wants to help Russia avoid similar embarrassment in future  At the moment a number of objective factors exclude the possibility for any cartels to dictate their will to the market      As for OPEC  it has practically stopped existing as a united organization   The company  Rosneft  was skeptical from the very beginning about the possibility of reaching any sort of joint agreement with OPEC s involvement in current conditions   said Sechin  in comments over the weekend which were embargoed until Tuesday  Just to remind you  the only one question with which we responded to those who were interested to know our position   Who should we agree with  and how   The development of the situation has clearly shown we were right  Sechin s comments about the end of the era when OPEC could influence prices chime with those of Saudi Arabia s newly appointed energy minister Khaled al Falih Falih  who took over on Saturday from long serving Ali al Naimi  has been very vocal in the past year about his views that the oil market needs to rebalance through low prices and that the Saudis have the resources to wait Falih s ultimate boss  Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  who oversees Saudi oil policies  has also signaled that the world is moving to a new era where supply and demand rather than OPEC will determine prices Sechin  who was born in        the same year as Falih   is also calling on Russia to abandon any hope that prices can be fixed by anything other than market rebalancing  At the moment  key factors which are influencing the market are finance  technology and regulation  We can see this with the example of shale oil which     became a powerful tool of influence on the global market   Sechin said in the emailed comments

Oil prices fell early on Thursday  weighed by the gradual return of Canadian oil sands production  reversing a sharp rise the previous day when the U S  government detailed an unexpected fall in crude inventories International Brent crude futures were trading at        per barrel at      GMT on Thursday  down    cents  or   percent  from their last settlement  U S  West Texas Intermediate  WTI  crude futures CLc  were down    cents or     percent at        Traders said the dips were largely a result of profit taking following intra day Brent price rises of up to       the previous day  A lot of people think that yesterday s jump was a bit over the top  so they ve taken the profit while they could this morning   said one oil trader The U S  Energy Information Administration  EIA  said on Wednesday that U S  crude inventories fell     million barrels to     million barrels last week  compared with analysts  expectations for an increase of         barrels and the American Petroleum Institute s  API  reported build of     million barrels in preliminary data issued on Tuesday The surprise draw in crude inventories was offset on Thursday by an expected increase in Canadian oil sand crude production following disruptions to over   million barrels of daily production capacity due to wildfire  We were not totally surprised with the draw after the shut in in Canadian production   said Tariq Zahir  managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York

As noon time temperatures began soaring in late March  Mohamed Nizam  a small scale chicken seller  knew he was headed for trouble Soon the mid day heat was touching    degrees Celsius  and Nizam told his workers to pour water on to the pavement in front of his shop in the Colombo suburb of Wattala in an effort to ward off the heat  But nothing can keep that kind of heat from getting to the chickens  It roasts them alive   Nizam said Across Sri Lanka  small  and medium scale chicken producers  often with between       and        birds  are struggling to keep their birds alive in the face of temperatures   degrees to   degrees Celsius above normal over the last two months Many of the birds live in tightly packed pens  where the heat makes them dehydrated  Larger industrial operations use fans and spray water on them  but smaller operations cannot afford such investments Usually when the heat is high  we use ice or water to keep the pens cool  This time they were no match for the heat  I lost half of my stock  said Rumi Jamaldean  who runs a farm with around       birds in the Kurunegala District  about     kilometres from Colombo RISING PRICESThe losses have translated into big hikes in chicken prices  In Colombo and its suburbs a kilo of fresh chicken was selling for     rupees  around        during the first week of May  Two months earlier it was Rs     and a year ago Rs     My sales have dropped  Nizam said  estimating they had fallen by    percent  People cant afford it  The prices are way too much  he said With chicken by far the most popular meat in this largely Buddhist nation that shuns many other types of meat  the price hike is likely to have an impact on nutrition  On average a Sri Lankan eats seven times as much chicken per year as beef  according to the Department of Animal Production and Health The nations poultry industry produces about         metric tons of meat a year  according to the Department of Animal Production and Health Sri Lankan chicken farmers have long experience with warm months and often use homegrown methods to keep their birds cool  including ice  water  fans or sometimes feeding the birds sodium bicarbonate  which growers say can help prevent dehydration But this time the heat was too much and nothing could have prevented such losses  said Nimal Jayaratne  head of the Department of Animal Production and Health According to the Meteorological Department  during the fourth week of April the Northern Vavuniya District recorded an average daily temperature of    degrees Celsius  During the same time period  rain fall was below average It has been extremely warm  warmer than any other time in the past five years  said Lal Chandrapala  director general of the Meteorological Department Experts and farmers agree that Sri Lankas small scale chicken farmers are not ready to deal with such extreme heat If you look at the pens  they are just brick sheds with corrugated tin sheets on the roof  During times when the weather is okay  they can work  But when the heat comes  there is hardly any room for ventilation and there is no money to invest to save the stock  Jayaratne said Chicken farmer Jamaldean said he will absorb the losses as much as he can  pass some portion of it to his customers  and just wait until the heat passes  with cooler monsoon weather due late this month or in early June But chicken prices will not come down soon  It will take at least two months  warned Nizam

Japans extraordinarily easy monetary policy  a source of friction with the United States for pushing the yens value down  has had some positive effects on emerging Asian economies  including increased growth and equity prices  International Monetary Fund researchers have found The IMF findings were released in a paper on Friday  as Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in Japan  where divergent views on Japans monetary policy and currency market interventions were expected to be a hot topic The paper claims to be the first to model the spillover effects of Japans qualitative and quantitative easing program  QQE  on Southeast Asian countries QQE was launched in      and targets both government bond purchases as well as other assets  such as exchange traded funds and real estate investment trusts The program has helped push down the yen from    to the dollar in      to     to the dollar by August       Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen  they mirrored some of these effects  study authors GiovanniGanelli  and Nour Tawk said   Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan  when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices  consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries  as well as an appreciation of their currencies   they wrote  Most  Southeast Asian  countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation  Capital inflows surged in many countries  They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing  this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period Instead  they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE The researchers said that Japans QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia  with increases in the   to   percent range for China  Indonesia  Malaysia  Singapore  Thailand  and Indonesia And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE  it had a  generally positive  impact on growth in emerging Asian countries  with statistically significant increases in br   Indonesia  Malaysia  the Philippines and Thailand

Indian farmers are set to reduce the area given over to soybeans by up to    percent this year in response to falling prices  pushing up likely imports of edible oils such as palm oil and soyoil Soybean is the main summer sown oilseed crop for the world s biggest importer of edible oil  but prices have dropped    percent in the past two years  while the prices of pulses such as red gram have nearly tripled over the same period Lower soybean output will force the country to increase imports of edible oils  supporting their prices  It could also limit India s soymeal exports  given prices for its GMO free produce are already above international prices The further price rise due to lower supply could even make imports of soymeal viable for local consumers  In the last two three years soybeans have given lower returns than competing crops like pulses   said K N Rahiman  chief research officer at Ruchi Soya  the country s biggest edible oil refiner  This year  since pulses prices are ruling near record high levels  farmers will be inclined to shift towards pulses  We could see   to    percent reduction in soybean area  Farmers planted       million hectares with soybean in          A    percent reduction would cut acreage to around      million hectares in the         marketing year starting July Most Indian farmers begin cultivating soybean and pulses  which are rain fed crops  in June after the arrival of the monsoon rains  and they are sown mainly in the states of Madhya Pradesh in central India  Maharashtra in the west  Rajasthan in the north west  and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the south Dinesh Garg  a farmer from Morena in Madhya Pradesh  plants soybean during summer  but this year he has decided instead to cultivate red gram  better known locally as tuar  Soybean is not remunerative due to lower prices  This year I am more interested in growing tuar   said Garg  who cultivated soybean on   hectares of land last year Soybean production plunged    percent in         to its lowest in more than a decade after drought and pests hit output India exports soymeal mainly to Asian buyers  but the drop in production has forced it to import soymeal and soybean in small quantities for the first time in many years Since the country imports most of its edible oil  limited soybean supply means imports will go up in          said Faiyaz Hudani  associate vice president  research  at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd  Even though oilseed production is stagnant  edible oil consumption has been rising steadily due to growth in population and rising prosperity   Hudani said India imports mainly palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia  while it brings in soyoil from Argentina and Brazil

LONDON OPEC s thorniest dilemma of the past year   at least from a purely oil standpoint   is about to disappear Less than six months after the lifting of Western sanctions  Iran is close to regaining normal oil export volumes  adding extra barrels to the market in an unexpectedly smooth way and helped by supply disruptions from Canada to Nigeria But the development will do little to repair dialogue  let alone help clinch a production deal  when OPEC meets next week amid rising political tensions between arch rivals Iran and oil superpower Saudi Arabia  OPEC sources and delegates say Earlier this year  Tehran refused to join an initiative to boost prices by freezing output but signaled it would be part of a future effort once its production had recovered sufficiently  OPEC has no supply limit  having at its last meeting in December scrapped its production target According to International Energy Agency  IEA  figures  Iran s output has reached levels seen before the imposition of sanctions over its nuclear program  Tehran says it is not yet there But while Iran may be more willing now to talk  an increase in oil prices has reduced the urgency of propping up the market  OPEC delegates say  Oil has risen toward a more producer friendly     from a    year low near     in January  I don t think OPEC will decide anything   a delegate from a major Middle East producer said   The market is recovering because of supply disruptions and demand recovery  A senior OPEC delegate  asked whether the group would make any changes to output policy at its June   meeting  said  Nothing  The freeze is finished Within OPEC  Iran has long pushed for measures to support oil prices  That position puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia  the driving force behind OPEC s landmark November      refusal to cut supply in order to boost the market Sources familiar with Iranian oil policy see no sign of any change of approach by Riyadh under new Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih   who is seen as a believer in reform and low oil prices  It really depends on those countries within OPEC with a high level of production   one such source said   It does not seem that Saudi Arabia will be ready to cooperate with other members  HIGHER EXPORTSIran has managed to increase oil exports significantly in      after the lifting of sanctions in January It notched up output of      million barrels of oil per day in April  the IEA said  a level last reached in November      before sanctions were tightened Saudi Arabia produced a near record high       million barrels per day in April and has kept output relatively steady over the past year  its submissions to OPEC show Iran  according to delegates from other OPEC members  is unlikely to restrain supplies  given that it believes Saudi Arabia should cut back itself to make room for Iranian oil  Iran won t support any freeze or cut   said a non Iranian OPEC delegate   But Iran may put pressure on Saudi Arabia that they hold the responsibility  Saudi thinking  however  has moved on from the days when Riyadh cut or increased output unilaterally  Talks in Doha on the proposed output freeze by OPEC and non OPEC producers fell through after Saudi insisted that Iran participate Indeed  differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran  which helped found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries    years ago  over OPEC policy have made cooperation harder   to say nothing of more fundamental disagreements For more than a decade after oil crashed to     in       the two set aside rivalries to manage the market and support prices  although they fell into opposing OPEC camps with Iran wanting high prices and Saudi more moderate Now  the Sunni Shia conflicts setting Saudi Arabia and Iran at each other s throats  particularly in Syria and Yemen  make the relationship between the two even more fraught The two disagree over OPEC s future direction  Earlier in May  OPEC failed to decide on a long term strategy as Saudi Arabia objected to Iran s proposal that the exporter group aim for  effective production management  With that backdrop  ministers may be advised to keep expectations low  an OPEC watcher said  The only aspiration OPEC should have for its   June meeting is simply not to repeat the chaos of the Doha process   said Paul Horsnell  analyst at Standard Chartered  A straightforward meeting with no binding commitments and  most importantly  no overt arguments would be the best outcome for ministers

NEW DELHI Anil Ambani s Reliance Group has never made a military helicopter  missile system or submarine in its history but that isn t stopping the Indian tycoon from seeking to win contracts to manufacture all of that military hardware and more Known for taking some ambitious bets over the past decade  some of which have failed to deliver  Ambani s plans to turn Reliance into a major defence company may be one of his boldest yet  It has already bid for     billion Indian rupees        billion  in government contracts  senior executives said  though it hasn t yet won any of those The success of the strategy will depend partly on whether he can persuade government officials and international partners that he can build sophisticated equipment and partly on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi can get India s notoriously slow procurement process to work Modi has made defence a big part of his  Make in India  programme  As part of any defence contract  he is demanding foreign companies tie up with a local partner  transfer technology and move some manufacturing to India At stake is      billion in defence contracts the government is expected to award over the next    years as it looks to upgrade the military s aging equipment   We hope to have a significant share of this pie   said R K Dhingra  chief executive of Reliance Defence  He predicted the company will  emerge as a key player in the defence sector over the next few years  Reliance s ambition is greeted with scepticism by many in the defence world  An military official involved in defence procurement said Reliance is overreaching in wanting to make everything from ships to planes  Some rivals and potential partners for the contracts said Reliance will struggle to master the manufacture of such a wide range of sophisticated military hardware  There is no quick money in this branch   said Jan Widerstrom  head of Saab India Technologies  a unit of Saab AB   It requires a lot of experience  high tech culture  investments and a long term business plan  Still  Saab and Reliance are working together in developing the next generation Combat Management System for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard Recently  Reliance s lack of experience and questions about its ability to handle sensitive technology and intellectual property counted against it in its bid to partner with the Russians to build     Kamov helicopters  said a Russian diplomat in New Delhi  who declined to be identified in this story because they weren t speaking in an official capacity The contract  estimated to be worth a little over      million went instead to Indian state controlled company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd Ambani should identify core areas and concentrate on them rather than  be an inch deep and a mile wide   said Nitin Gokhale  founder of defence website Bharat Shakti RELIANCE GROUPThe Reliance conglomerate split into two in      after a bitter feud between Anil Ambani and his older brother  Mukesh  The latter got the flagship Reliance Industries  with interests in petrochemicals  oil and gas exploration  refining and textiles Anil got telecoms  power  entertainment and financial services businesses  But some of his businesses struggled  especially an ill timed foray into infrastructure  and debt piled up Its Reliance Infrastructure arm  which includes the defence operations  aims to be debt free in the current financial year ending March       according to Lalit Jalan  who is acting CEO of the unit To get there it plans to sell assets  including road projects and a stake in a power distribution company for about     billion rupees  according to another senior Reliance executive  Ambani entered the defence sector last year  when he took a controlling stake in a company that made warships and energy exploration vessels  in Modi s home state of Gujarat  called Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co Ltd  for about    billion Indian rupees That became Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd  Since then  Reliance has bought hundreds of acres of additional land to build an aerospace facility and another shipyard in other parts of the country It has also signed more than half a dozen joint venture agreements with foreign companies  including one with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems of Israel  to bid for Indian government contracts as they come up An Israeli defence industry source said for Rafael the idea is that if it wins tenders  Reliance will produce some components for missiles and other systems BUILDING EXPERIENCEAmbani has said that lack of experience is being held against his company  Despite a committed reformist mindset at the top  we are still seeing opportunities being denied to new players on grounds of lack of experience   Ambani told a  Make in India  summit on defence in March Reliance Defence has been building an experienced team  Dhingra earlier headed Lockheed Martin s India operations  and the company has hired a slew of senior army and navy officers who have executed large defence projects from conception to delivery  the Reliance executive said The group s experience in managing complex projects in India  including building roads and power plants should help it  the executive said  For design  technology and complicated weaponry  Reliance would have a foreign partner  he noted Reliance expects to spend up to    billion rupees over the next three years in upgrading facilities as it gets business  keeping its outlay low as it waits for contracts  the executive said Thanks to its Pipavav shipyard  Reliance expects the naval part of its business to be the first to take off  he said  It plans to bid for a      billion submarine contract that the government is expected to give out to replace the navy s ageing and accident prone fleet and narrow the gap with rival China s rapidly modernizing fleet Ambani also has plans to bid for contracts in the future to make nuclear powered submarines            Indian

Ireland would have to consider taking steps to assist firms exporting into Britain if its nearest neighbour and largest trade partner votes to leave the European Union  Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told Reuters on Wednesday Ireland s economy is more vulnerable than any other in the EU if Britain opts to leave  and ministers including Flanagan have campaigned in Britain ahead of Thursday s referendum to urge Irish voters living there to vote  Remain  Irish exporters would be the first to suffer if Brexit significantly weakened the pound against the euro and Flanagan said concerns had been raised in meetings with trade bodies during the campaign  It s too early for me to speculate as to the nature of any actions that we may take but we are fully sensitive to the challenge that lies ahead and the need to respond accordingly   Flanagan said when asked if there were any policy steps that could aid exporters DUBLIN   In the event of there being a vote to leave  we would be primarily focussed on strategic national Irish interests across a range of issues  primarily economic and trade  so we have prepared a plan across a range of departments  Around     billion euros        billion  of goods and services are traded between the United Kingdom and Ireland each week with Irish farmers and food producers  major UK suppliers  particularly vulnerable Flanagan  serving a second term as foreign minister after his Fine Gael party returned to office last month  also predicted any withdrawal negotiations could take much longer than the two year period laid down in EU law Of most concern to Ireland during such a process would be the impact on Northern Ireland  which has the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU While pro Brexit campaigners say a vote to leave would not endanger a common travel area that predates both countries  entry into the EU in       Flanagan said he could not see why the reintroduction of a hard border would not be considered Given the prominence of immigration as a campaign issue  he said  it would seem logical that Britain would be inclined to take some action if it was outside the EU  In that case  Dublin was concerned that the negotiation on a form of border would be done at EU level and therefore not entirely under its control The fear for many is that any new border restrictions could endanger an    year old peace agreement between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and their Protestant rivals who want to keep Northern Ireland British  At best  I would point to a period of uncertainty that would affect the great progress that has been made  in Northern Ireland  in recent years   Flanagan said in his office in Dublin s government buildings  And in terms of the peace process  any re introduction of border controls  either in terms of custom controls for trade or in terms of security  that could well pose us with a difficult challenge

GENEVA In a packed Christie s auction room in Geneva  one could hear a pin drop as two anonymous bidders slugged it out in their quest to own the world s most exquisite blue diamond The room in the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues was filled with multi millionaire collectors and diamond dealers  listening intently as the bidders  each speaking by phone to a Christie s representative  took turns adding a few hundred thousand dollars in a tense struggle dragging on for more than half an hour When the auctioneer s hammer came down  spontaneous applause broke out as the winner  who retained anonymity  bought the       carat Oppenheimer Blue for a world record       million for any jewel sold at auction  The sale some weeks ago was the latest in a series of world record prices per carat paid at auction for extraordinarily magnificent and rare diamonds With new fortunes being created around the world faster than at any time in history  more of this expanding elite of wealthy investors are looking at different ways of protecting cash that now earns close to zero percent interest in bank accounts  while asset market turbulence can wipe out millions in hours Some are eyeing rare diamonds as a best friend  or long term haven at least  And it s no longer just a top table of  super rich  billionaires who are gravitating to this arcane world A second division of wealthy is emerging  They can t afford the Oppenheimer Blue  perhaps  but they can take a stake in rare diamonds via specialist investment funds PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS  CLUB ONLYThese gem specialists are keen to play up rare diamonds as  safety  investments  or at least a way to hedge against currency  stock and bond market volatility at a time of political and economic uncertainty  Britain s shock vote last month to leave the European Union underlines their point  The big players are looking at diamonds in a different way   said Ehud Laniado  chief executive of Cora International  which sold the       carat Blue Moon diamond for       million at a Sotheby s Geneva sale in November  a world record for any jewel sold at auction at the time  They are not looking at them just as a jewel  but as an asset that has a resale value  Citigroup said the outlook for gold remained uncertain partly due to concerns about a possible increase in U S  interest rates  In such a scenario  investors may look at a next best alternative such as diamonds However  the diamond investors  club is shut to most ordinary savers due to its complicated  insider nature   characterised by poor liquidity  a lack of price transparency and high fees  While some are making efforts to create a liquid market  the process has been slow Entry level for Sciens Coloured Diamond Fund II  one of the more established closed end funds now shut to new investors  is    million  It invests in diamonds in rare colours such as red The fund  which manages around     million  uses trading and buy and hold strategies for long term appreciation  One of its strategies is to improve the value of stones by finding a rare matching pair in the same colour  size and shape  They are eventually sold to buyers such as jewellers and collectors Some funds also loan diamonds to jewellers who wish not to maintain a large inventory  If the jeweller decides to make a unique ring for a client  he can buy a diamond from the fund The Sciens fund  launched in       rose in value by about   percent in the second quarter of       said Philip Baldwin  managing director of Sciens Diamond Management BV  He and Mahyar Makhzani run the fund  based on the Caribbean island of Curacao  Colour diamonds are considered a safe haven   he said   Colour diamonds are a hedge against inflation  currency risk  market fluctuations and political uncertainty  Solitaire Diamond Co  another diamond backed fund now closed to new investors  is backed by an assortment of white diamonds of high grade clarity and cut weighing under   carats  which are certified by international laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America Fred Sinclair Brown  Solitaire fund manager  said it made a gross margin of    percent over the past    months  above expectations of    to    percent  He said he was planning another diamond fund for professional investors  this time possibly backed by coloured gems INVESTORS SEE SPARKLE IN COLOUR GEMSPrices of vivid and intense colour diamonds have risen    to    percent a year on average since       according to Baldwin  However  dealers said white diamond prices had not gained as quickly in recent years and were largely flat in      The most prominent white diamond to come to auction recently  the       carat Lesedi la Rona  failed to sell at Sotheby s in London last month  highlighting that diamond markets are not bulletproof Diamond markets slowed in the second quarter as selective buyers pushed for deeper discounts  Polished inventory continued to rise and prices came under pressure  while rough trading remained resilient Despite a handful of diamond backed initiatives  fund managers have struggled over the years to find the right investment vehicles for diamonds due to illiquidity  a lack of price transparency and high transaction fees  I am very dubious about diamond backed investment because the price of diamonds is not listed anywhere and the market is too illiquid   said Edmund Shing  strategist at BNP Paribas and former global equity fund manager of BCS Asset Management Fund managers pointed to very separate markets for white diamonds  While white diamonds can be correlated to the commercial market for bridal jewellery  colour gems are in a unique investment category  Part of the problem with diamond investing is that different categories make it difficult to compile generic prices A recent Citigroup poll found that about one third of the respondents were willing to invest in a diamond product having homogeneity and liquidity Martin Rapaport  head of the Rapaport Group  which has its own polished diamond price list widely used by the trade  is trying to create a more liquid market for investment grade diamonds by developing a transparent price structure  He hopes to launch a fund backed by diamonds within a couple of years  Diamonds can be a good investment  but you have to be careful   he told Reuters   You need to know the bid ask spread  the price you can sell diamonds back on the same day

SINGAPORE Chinese state backed firms are frontrunners to buy a      billion controlling stake in Pakistani utility K Electric  sources said  as they bet the benefits of a Beijing led economic corridor will trump the risks of investing in Pakistan State backed Shanghai Electric Power         SS  and China Southern Power Grid are among Chinese firms leading the pack of about half a dozen bidders in K Electric KELA KA  one person familiar with the matter said Shanghai headquartered Golden Concord Holdings is also among the bidders  as are some local Pakistani and other companies  according to people who know about the process Chinese companies  interest comes after China last year announced energy and infrastructure projects worth     billion in the South Asian nation  with a view to opening a trade corridor linking western China with the Arabian Sea  The China Pakistan Economic Corridor  CPEC  is the main driver  with a lot of Chinese funding flowing into Pakistan   said one person aware of the K Electric deal That demand underpins President Xi Jinping s ambitious  One Belt  One Road  initiative  under which Beijing is seeking to open new trade routes and markets as the domestic economy slows Under the program  Chinese companies invested nearly     billion in participating countries last year  up one fifth from      If successful  the K Electric deal would be the biggest M amp A agreement in Pakistan in a decade  Large tracts of Pakistan s economy remain nationalized or held by private businessmen with little interest in selling to new investors Chinese firms are eyeing new Pakistan power projects  roads and some engineering contracts but investing in a large private company that deals directly with consumers would be a first  a senior Karachi based financial adviser said NO GUARANTEEDubai based private equity firm Abraaj Group  whose    percent stake in K Electric has a market value of about      billion  is seeking final bids for its stake by the end of August Sources cautioned that although talks between the parties are advanced  there is no certainty of a deal being clinched The Pakistani government owns about    percent  but a spokesman for the water and power ministry said it was not in talks to sell CPEC envisages the construction of roads  pipelines and power plants across Pakistan that run south to Gwadar port and should mean more business for distribution companies like K Electric that sell the electricity to users China and Pakistan call each other  all weather friends  and their ties have been underpinned by long standing wariness of their common neighbor  India  and a desire to hedge against U S  influence in the region Islamabad wants Chinese funding to reinvigorate an economy hurt by militant violence and weak productivity  to provide new jobs and to ease chronic power shortages For China  markets like Pakistan and Malaysia are opening up new frontiers  just as it faces hurdles in countries including Australia  CHINESE ARE COMING  We are getting a lot more enquiries from Chinese investors about Pakistan in the last couple of years   said Muhammad Sohail  CEO at Karachi based brokerage Topline Securities  Before it was always U S  and Europe  The Chinese are coming   Sohail added Still  foreign investment in Pakistan remains relatively muted as it struggles to shake off a reputation for violence  corruption and instability  and despite the      billion economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years Inbound M amp A into Pakistan has risen more than six times in the past five years  totaling      million so far this year  according to Thomson Reuters data K Electric  Pakistan s biggest electricity company  supplies power to over     million customers in and around Karachi  the country s biggest and wealthiest city The utility has undergone a turnaround since Abraaj bought it  K Electric has cut down on electricity theft and reduced outages  Abraaj has done a good job but for a newcomer to get involved in a city like Karachi is not easy   said the Karachi based adviser  referring to a city where power theft  violence and political turmoil have scared investors away  The Chinese are looking at a lot of things but they are also very cautious  Sources said some Pakistani firms were also bidding  but it was not clear how keen they were  and they would likely find it tough to match the Chinese in an auction which could go as high as    billion China Southern Power Grid declined comment  while Shanghai Electric Power confirmed it was bidding but gave no details A K Electric spokeswoman said the company had not been notified about any transaction or acquisition   We dismiss these rumors as speculative   she said  A spokeswoman at Abraaj declined comment Though

A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U S  big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high end fiber market  there isn t much Egyptian cotton any more The shortage of cotton from Egypt  which commands a premium due to its superior quality  creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether  cotton traders said  exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years Welspun India has lost    percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer  one of the world s largest  accusing it of substituting cheaper  non Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is  long staple  or  extra long staple   meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer  resulting in a finer  lighter more durable fabric and longer lasting  higher end clothing While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high end cotton than Egypt  cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop But Egypt s cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass produced items made from short  or medium staple fiber  according to the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  The decline has become a full fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies  and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice  the USDA said Egypt will produce just             lb bales of cotton in          down from     million bales as recently as          accounting for less than     percent of expected global output This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not  or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure  said Jordan Lea  chairman and co owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville  South Carolina  If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale  and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that s produced  it would lead one to scratch one s head   Lea said A GOLD SEAL Long and extra long staple cotton is rare   it makes up just     percent of annual world cotton production of more than     million bales  according to the USDA   and trades at a substantial premium U S  extra long staple cotton  or  pima   trades for        cents per lb  according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data  a     percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U S   a contract that accepts cotton of a  strict low middling staple length  Ron Lawson  a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma  California  said he had  no idea  what Egyptian cotton prices were  which he said showed how much of a  novelty  item the fiber was Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U S  Textile Act and Rules  which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target s allegations or had started an investigation Egypt s cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting  In April  its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled  Egyptian cotton  and found that    percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association s  Gold Seal   which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity Mukesh Saviani  a Welspun executive  told the trade publication in February that the seal was  an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues  The scandal could leave big box U S  retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton  potentially providing a boon to growers of U S  Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona  The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now   Lawson said  referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from     percent American Pima cotton

China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world s biggest economies this weekend  but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage Ensuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping s priorities  and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G   summit to be Beijing wants to use the Sept     meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth  but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism  diplomats said  From where China sits  it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them   said a senior Western envoy  describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G   as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U S  anti missile system to be deployed in South Korea In recent months  China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court  a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully  Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea  going by reports in state media China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting  which will be attended by U S  President Barack Obama  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe  and other world leaders State media has given great play to the idea that G   is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth  with the official People s Daily saying this could be one of the G   s most fruitful ever get togethers  Let s make cooperation ever higher   it wrote in a commentary last week But the state run Study Times wrote in mid August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U S  led Trans Pacific Partnership  Trying to get back their right to global governance  they are forging a new  sacred alliance   striving to establish new rules   the influential paper  published twice a week by the Central Party School  wrote in a G   commentary  These new rules will exclude China  ANGERED BY BRITAIN  AUSTRALIAOverseas  China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries  saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia Australia has blocked the A    billion       billion  sale of the country s biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders  while Britain has delayed a     billion Chinese invested nuclear project But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it Joerg Wuttke  the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China  said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China s overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies   It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more  They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies   Wuttke told Reuters A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China s attitude on protectionism  The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids  You wouldn t get to the end of the sentence   the official added None of this will make for plain sailing at G    China is angry with almost everyone at the moment   said a second Beijing based Western diplomat familiar with the summit To be sure  China does want G   to go smoothly  said a third Western diplomat  It s very important from the stance of national pride   said the diplomat  pointing out it was not uncommon for G  s to be hijacked by issues other than economics  It s a minefield for China  JAPAN WORRIESThen there is Japan  a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea Last week  China s top diplomat called on Japan to be  constructive  at G    with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well  at the behest of its ally the United States Wang Youming  the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry backed China Institute of International Studies  wrote in the widely read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G   got  the more Japan was trying to cause trouble  Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues  cozying up to the Philippines  and urging China to respect the result of the so called  arbitration  case   Wang wrote  Japan is up to its old tricks  and it s hard not to think they are trying to mess things up

LONDON Some of the world s biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law  part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow Unilever  Beiersdorf and L Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world s biggest Muslim majority nation The law  the first of its kind  requires food to be labeled halal or not in       followed by toiletries in      and medicines in      The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal  or target specific issues like veiled hair  will grow as the Muslim middle class grows  They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small  niche companies are also popular Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law  This means it must not contain traces of pork  alcohol or blood  and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk  including from cleaning Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial  and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams  It s an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world   said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF  which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has     of them certified halal  The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags  he said  There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more  and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing  More than     billion people around the world are Muslim  accounting for about a quarter of the global population Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up    percent of a global halal market worth more than    trillion in       according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting  Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products  sales growing

largely on plant derived ingredients  so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation But certification can get complicated  For example  the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way Malaysia based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants  As of February  it said    out of over     certification bodies worldwide had signed up The company  which also runs a halal e commerce site  reported      revenue of     million Malaysian ringgit       million   up    percent year on year  It raised     million pounds       million  from this year s London stock listing  and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia  Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future   Joerg Karas  general manager of Schwan Stabilo Cosmetics  said in a statement last month  The German company  which is ready to offer halal certified products to customers such as L Oreal and Procter  amp  Gamble  said it is  well equipped for this niche market  Non halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law  but may meet a backlash  The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it   said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants Unilever  which owns five of Indonesia s top ten beauty and personal care brands  says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third party suppliers of imported ingredients Alan Jope  who runs Unilever s personal care business from Singapore  told Reuters the cost of certification was  not material  MUSLIM VALUESCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce  especially when it comes to regulation  But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever    with global marketing and development teams    is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities  Some  values  are common across Muslim countries   he said  noting that about    percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices  But there s quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes  He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever s    billion euros per year business were countries with large Muslim populations  from India to Nigeria  He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority To that end  Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan Like rival Henkel  it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair  but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising  such as by featuring more women in hijabs  We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication   he said              ringgit              pounds

KABUL  Tax exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market  industry officials and a new anti corruption report reveal  causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid An AFP team witnessed first hand evidence hinting at how duty free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards  the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers  scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry Among the documents from one driver was a  maafinama     a tax exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around      a ton    showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries    responsible for Afghan military and police    is exempted from custom duty  following a security agreement between the government and NATO  What is this fuel doing in this market   asked the official  standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations  Thats the big question   he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck  pledging a full investigation He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasons  Misuse  No commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war ravaged Afghanistan as fuel    and none more at risk of being stolen  smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption  observers say Last year  more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan  the finance ministry said  with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around      million  The custom duty exemption mechanism     for  international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit   said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee  MEC   which was seen by AFP The report  due to be released on Tuesday  said    commercial companies were issued tax exemption certificates last year The process to obtain  maafinamas  involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military  NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries    but the document remains prone to  misuse   Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies   the report said  explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market   Also  after the customs department process the exemption paperwork  the companies that have been granted exemption forms re sell the fuel  NATO said it could not immediately comment  and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFPs queries Shafiq Qarizada  deputy minister for customs  told AFP he  cannot confirm nor deny  whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market   Contaminated  The comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October  where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years Afghanistan is battling what observers label  donor fatigue  as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs  two private traders told AFP The exemption waves off    percent customs duty among other charges  officials say  Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market   said the official who carried out the inspection  How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel  This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel    and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions  The misuse also has potential military implications In May last year    Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles  raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas  multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries  MEC understands from interviews with both  NATO  and  finance ministry  that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented   the MEC report said  Why not  Is the reason for the delay perhaps another instance of corruption  
HANGZHOU  CHINA  The global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets  Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the open of a two day summit of leaders from G   nations His warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U S  president described as  extremely productive   but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea With the summit taking place after Britain s vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U S  presidential election in November  observers expect G   leaders to mount a defense of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism The global economy has arrived  at a crucial juncture   Xi said  in the face of sluggish demand  volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment  Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading  while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum   he said G   countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures   including monetary  fiscal and structural reforms   should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth  Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said  Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid  sustainable  balanced and inclusive growth   Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit Xi also called on G   countries to match their words with actions  We should turn the G   group into an action team  instead of a talk shop   he said But some of the G   leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity BATTLE LINESOn Sunday  Xi held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and told him he hoped Australia would continue to provide a fair  transparent and predictable policy environment for foreign investors China was angered when Australia blocked the A    billion       billion  sale of the country s biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders last month China has accused Australia of bowing to protectionist sentiment in blocking the bid for Ausgrid  as well as an earlier one by a China led consortium to buy cattle company Kidman  amp  Co Beijing has also criticized Australia  a staunch U S  ally  for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea Meanwhile  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity  saying it was  unacceptable  the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years  Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element   he told a news conference Britain s future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain s closest political  commercial and military ally would stand by her But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union s common market  it needed to respect the rules of the common market Turnbull  meanwhile  said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea  and stressed U S  commitments to its regional allies Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it According to a  fact sheet  on China U S  relations issued on Sunday  the two sides agreed on a range of issues  including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers Obama  now in the last five months of his presidency  is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific  setting the tone for his White House successor  who will be elected in November and take office on Jan     His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport  where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access  Obama said on Sunday he  wouldn t over crank the significance  of the airport events  None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship  with China    he told a news conference   The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation  Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou  with parts of the city of   million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G   summit stays incident

India will present proposals to the World Trade Organization on ways to ease trade in services  Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday  as Asia s third largest economy seeks to leverage one of its competitive strengths India cleared the way for a WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement covering goods in       after tortuous talks in which it won a concession letting it stockpile strategic food reserves for its mostly poor population of     billion people New Delhi has often dragged its feet in the multilateral arena and been reluctant to cut bilateral free trade deals because experience has shown its goods sector often cannot compete on international markets By contrast  India s services sector  including back office operations for multinationals  is a big export earner and the idea of striking a similar multilateral deal on services first came up at a meeting of trade ministers in Paris in June  While there seems to be trade facilitation for goods  there doesn t seem to be trade facilitation for services  and that was a point I made in Paris   Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters at a business conference in New Delhi  This is a matter on which the WTO will now have to work   said Sitharaman  speaking on the sidelines of the Economist India Summit Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for freer trade in services at the recent Group of    summit hosted by China and  Sitharaman said  India will soon submit a paper to the WTO as requested at the Paris meeting Modi told the G   grouping that a knowledge and innovation driven economy required free movement of professional workers Restrictions on the admission of Indian IT experts have been one area of concern between the United States and India  and figured in recent two way strategic and commercial talks

SAN FRANCISCO U S  Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output  productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades It would be the fourth time in    months that the U S  central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so called neutral rate was too optimistic  raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years The Fed  however  still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer run rate at this week s monetary policy meeting  with the median forecast possibly falling to      percent  It was      percent in June      and      percent four years ago The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two day meeting on Wednesday  according to a Reuters poll of economists The Fed s policy rate has been about      percent since it was raised in December  the first increase in nearly a decade The expected reduction in the longer run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes  and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U S  central bankers and investors had expected The lower the neutral rate forecast  the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy  which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases The result  says San Francisco Fed President John Williams  will be the  shallowest  set of rate hikes ever   much flatter   according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation  than anything in the past The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in       That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year  with another three hikes in       due to a global growth slowdown  financial market volatility and tepid U S  inflation But given the new thinking on the neutral rate  that seems overly optimistic Fed policymakers say an aging U S  population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential  making them wary about raising rates too fast  They are not very far from being in a tightening mode   said Shehriyar Antia  founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed   That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain t going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation  FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week  Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank s so called toolbox   its more than    trillion in Treasuries and mortgage backed securities  low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus   is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole  Wyoming  Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn But the Fed s constant walk backs have served to undercut some of the market s faith in the central bank  Traders of short term rate futures  for instance  are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year Still  any cut to the Fed s neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates  They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one   said Sam Bullard  a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte  North Carolina The Fed is due to release its policy statement at   p m  EDT       GMT  on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after  The Fed s rate setting committee will meet again in early November and mid December

ALGIERS  OPEC agreed on Wednesday modest oil output cuts in the first such deal since       with the group s leader Saudi Arabia softening its stance on arch rival Iran amid mounting pressure from low oil prices  OPEC made an exceptional decision today     After two and a half years  OPEC reached consensus to manage the market   said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh  who had repeatedly clashed with Saudi Arabia during previous meetings He and other ministers said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce output to a range of           million barrels per day  OPEC estimates its current output at       million bpd  We have decided to decrease the production around         bpd   Zanganeh said The move would effectively re establish OPEC production ceilings abandoned a year ago However  how much each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November  when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non OPEC countries such as Russia Oil prices LCOc  jumped more than   percent to trade above     per barrel as of      GMT  Many traders said they were impressed OPEC had managed to reach a compromise after years of wrangling but others said they wanted to see the details  This is the first OPEC deal in eight years  The cartel proved that it still matters even in the age of shale  This is the end of the production war  and OPEC claims victory   said Phil Flynn  senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group Jeff Quigley  director of energy markets at Houston based Stratas Advisors  said the market had yet to discover who would produce what   I want to hear from the mouth of the Iranian oil minister that hes not going to go back to pre sanction levels  For the Saudis  it just goes against the conventional wisdom of what theyve been saying   Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al Falih said on Tuesday that Iran  Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce  at maximum levels that make sense  as part of any output limits That represents a strategy shift for Riyadh  which had said it would reduce output to ease a global glut only if every other OPEC and non OPEC producer followed suit  Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post sanctions environment  Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since      and its economy could expand by almost   percent this year  according to the International Monetary Fund Riyadh  on the other hand  faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of     billion last year  a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees OIL PRICE PRESSURESSaudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than      million bpd  on par with Russia and the United States  Together  the three largest global producers extract a third of the world s oil Iran s production has been stagnant at     million bpd in the past three months  close to pre sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than   million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years  forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year  The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years     said Raza Agha  chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital   So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi  However  with unemployment in double digits  Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations  But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia  which are fighting several proxy wars in the Middle East  including in Syria and Yemen OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of      million bpd to around      million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of         million bpd Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran s output was limited by sanctions  Minister Zanganeh has said Iran wanted an output cap of close to   million bpd  Saudi output drops in winter when it needs less fuel than during summer  when cooling requirements spike

Oil prices surged Thursday after the OPEC producers group surprised the market with a deal to slash output At the end of six hours of negotiations and weeks of horse trading  OPEC announced the plan to cut production to a level of         million barrels per day  bpd  from       billion  bpd in August  the International Energy Agency  IEA  said The informal meeting was held on the sidelines of an IEA meeting in a bid to stabilise prices that have been battered by a stubborn supply glut since      Oil prices soared by as much as six percent following the news and extended gains in Asian trade on Thursday although at a slower pace At around      GMT  US benchmark West Texas Intermediate  WTI  for delivery in November was up    cents to        and Brent crude for November added    cents to        a barrel The decision to cut output caught the market offguard Market watchers had been pessimistic about a cut or a freeze after similar efforts fell apart in April due to disagreements between OPEC majors Saudi Arabia and Iran Angus Nicholson  a Melbourne based analyst with IG Markets said the OPEC decision was the main impetus for the price surge but said details of the deal  sound a bit fuzzy at the moment   There is the possibility that OPEC managed to commit to a weak deal at this meeting that may pave the way for a more comprehensive production cut at the November meeting   he said in a note  referring to OPECs formal meeting on November     A more comprehensive deal from OPEC and Russia at the November meeting would easily clear the way for WTI oil to trade around US     Nicholson also said official data showing a fall in the weekly US commercial crude inventories helped to boost the market The US Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stocks in the worlds top oil consumer fell by     million barrels  confounding expectations for a rise of three million barrels A decline in crude stocks signals stronger consumption and is positive for oil prices  This has now been four straight weeks of back to back declines in crude oil inventories  which is also very supportive of the spot price   Nicholson said
