"Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is ""barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greeces exit ""almost inevitable"" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens removal from the bloc would be ""manageable"", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.""The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,"" IGs Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

"US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Mondays slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""Theres serious concern the bottoms not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone whos taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybodys guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraqs oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really dont see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

"Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

"Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moodys warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moodys said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moodys, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the countrys oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moodys warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The governments targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistans import bill, it added.",business

"The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greeces new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sundays Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greeces repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher.

Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didnt see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the worlds largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""Its too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh.

"State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the countrys Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sectors profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industrys share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lions share of financing by the countrys Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.",business

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March advanced $1 to $52.69 a barrel compared with Fridays close.Brent North Sea crude for March won 63 cents to stand at $58.43 a barrel in London afternoon trade.Last week saw WTI surge seven percent and Brent add 9.4 percent, their best weekly gains since February 2011.Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said the gains were ""motivated by supply-side influences"" in the United States.A survey by US oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc released Friday showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 to 1,140 in the week to February 6. The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the worlds biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

"British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.""We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,"" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britains The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.",business

Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.""The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,"" the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring ""relatively swiftly"", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.""This mornings slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

"The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest  and most influential  to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year  barely enough to cover just the countrys defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught  several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBRs commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.War on tax cheats""FBR is after those who cant influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistans richest whose names were missing from a list of the countrys top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistans central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent  but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the governments reform programme  tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender  was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the governments efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.",business
"The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki.

"Asian markets mostly wound back Thursday, in line with a hefty sell-off on Wall Street, after surprisingly weak US data hinted at ongoing weakness in the worlds number one economy.The euro broke above $1.10, boosted by receding expectations of an early US rate hike and upbeat indicators out of the eurozone.Oil prices also enjoyed support from concerns about unrest in the crude-rich Middle East following news that Saudi jets had struck rebel positions in neighbouring Yemen.Tokyo tumbled 1.39 percent, or 275.08 points, to 19,471.12 after earlier this week touching a 15-year high, while Sydney sank 1.58 percent, or 94.22 points, to close at 5,879.1 and Seoul fell 0.99 percent, or 20.25 points, to 2,022.56.Hong Kong lost 0.13 percent, dropping 31.15 points to 24,497.08 but Shanghai gained 0.58 percent, or 21.37 points, to 3,682.10, having fallen Wednesday for the first time in 11 sessions.US investors ran for the sidelines Wednesday after the Commerce Department said durable goods orders fell in February after Januarys gain.While the news will likely put back the Federal Reserves timeline on when to raise interest rates, it was taken Wednesday by investors as a sign of weakness, fuelling fears about the global outlook.The Nasdaq fell 2.37 percent, the Dow tumbled 1.62 percent and the S&P 500 gave up 1.46 percent.""Wall Street is struggling to add to its recent record high and it looks like the upward momentum is starting to show signs of fatigue,"" Matthew Sherwood, head of investment markets research in Sydney at Perpetual Ltd., told Bloomberg News.""Asia has an advantage over the US as Asia has cheaper valuations.

"Oil prices fell in thin pre-holiday trade in Asia Thursday after a mixed US stockpiles report, while talks over crude producer Irans nuclear programme dragged on, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 40 cents to $49.69 while Brent slipped 32 cents to $56.78 in afternoon trade.""Prices have come off with thin volumes ahead of the holiday tomorrow,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP.Financial markets in major crude trading hubs including Singapore, the United States and Britain will be closed on Friday for the long Easter weekend.McCarthy said dealers were still digesting the latest US Department of Energys weekly petroleum report released Wednesday.The report, for the week to March 27, showed another increase in inventories to a new record high of 471.4 million barrels.But it also revealed a slight decline in US production of 36,000 barrels per day, ending a long climb to record output levels that have contributed to the global supply glut.""The decline in crude production does give some hope that the state of oversupply can be brought under control, and bring about a lift in prices,"" McCarthy said.Talks between Iran and world powers aimed at preventing Tehran from getting a nuclear bomb remained in focus, he added.""We are a few metres... from the finishing line, but we are well aware that the final metres are the hardest,"" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters as he arrived late Wednesday back in Switzerland to rejoin the negotiations.The United States, China, Britain, Russia, France and Germany hope a full agreement, due to be finalised by June 30, will see Iran scale back its nuclear capability, which would prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.In return, the diplomatically isolated Islamic republic, which denies wanting to build a bomb, is demanding the lifting of sanctions that have strangled its energy-reliant economy.

"Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Irans nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group  the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany  hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the worlds fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC members crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.",business
"Oil futures climbed more than $1 a barrel on Monday, after Saudi Arabia raised prices for crude sales to Asia for a second month, signalling better demand in the region.International benchmark Brent regained ground after tumbling as much as 5 percent on Thursday, when a preliminary nuclear deal was finally reached between world powers and Iran. More Iranian oil could enter global markets if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.""While clearly a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number of obstacles,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.""Even if a final deal is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,"" the analysts said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21 higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working, although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai quotes, analysts said.""There is still competition for the Asia market even though it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete in the market right now,"" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.",business

Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts had surged by three dollars each on Monday.""The current decline in oil prices is most likely due to profit-taking,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.""Most traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as sanctions get lifted,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. ""However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions would only be lifted slowly,"" he added.Iran has the worlds fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.

"Asian markets rallied Wednesday, led by an almost four percent surge in Hong Kong on its first post-holiday trading day as it reacted to weak US jobs data that reduced the chances of a rate rise any time soon.The Japanese central banks decision to delay any new easing measures pushed the yen up against the dollar, while investors await the release of minutes from the Federal Reserves latest policy meeting.Oil prices ticked lower on profit-taking in Asia after climbing Tuesday to their highest level of 2015.Hong Kong, which last traded on Thursday, soared 3.80 percent, or 961.22 points, to 26,236.86.Shanghai ended 0.84 percent, or 33.43 points higher at 3,994.81 and Tokyo added 0.76 percent, or 149.27 points, to 19,789.81.Sydney rose 0.59 percent, or 34.7 points, to 5,960.7 and Seoul advanced 0.60 percent, or 12.23 points, to end at 2,059.26.Last weeks Labor Department data showing that the US economy created fewer jobs in March than it had for more than a year raised expectations that rates will be kept low through the summer.The next focal point is the release later Wednesday of minutes from the last Fed meeting, with dealers poring over them for clues about when the bank plans to announce a rise.In currency trading the dollar edged down after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy even though the country is struggling to overcome anaemic price growth.The dollar bought 119.88 yen, down from 120.32 yen in New York Tuesday but well above the low-119 yen range seen in Tokyo at the start of the week soon after the US jobs data.- Greece fears linger -""Theres still a little bit of doubt in the market as to really where the US economy is, and more importantly, how the Fed perceives the US economy,"" Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand, told Bloomberg News.

"Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher.

However, they will also reinforce investors expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kongs market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghais exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GEs announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months.

"Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central banks efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed on Tuesday.Analyst said banks hefty invested into the government papers and low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9 billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of banks higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through the opening market operations.Tuesdays data on monetary aggregates depicted that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230 trillion from a same period a year ago.The governments rising demand for bank borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the legal framework for creditors rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and impaired access to finance.",business
"US oil prices shot up to a 2015 peak Wednesday after a slight dip in US oil production sparked talk that the glutted petroleum market could be turning.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery jumped $3.10 to $56.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest closing price since December 23.European benchmark Brent oil for delivery in May rose $1.89 to $60.32 a barrel in London.The gains extended a market rally into a fifth straight day.Earlier in the day, the US Department of Energy reported US oil production fell by 20,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 9.38 million barrels per day, in the week ending April 10.US crude inventories stand at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years, the DoE said, but the increase last week was smaller than expected.Analysts expressed caution at Wednesdays price surge.""I think this rally will stall,"" said Matt Smith, an analyst at Schneider Electric. ""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here.""

"Pakistan needs a huge amount of financing for infrastructure and energy projects and China is ready to announce help when President Xi Jinping visits next week, a foreign ministry official said Friday.Islamabad has for decades been Beijings closest ally in South Asia, and China -- which is expanding its influence in the region -- is a major trading partner and key supplier of military technology to Pakistan.Chinese assistant foreign minister Liu Jianchao declined to offer details in a briefing to reporters ahead of Xis two-day trip, which starts Monday, saying that the ""specific figure"" would be announced during the visit.But he said a ""huge amount of financing"" was needed for projects in the transport, infrastructure and energy fields that are part of a China-Pakistan economic corridor initiative.""China stands ready to provide financial support for Pakistan to be used on these projects,"" Liu said.The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi would announce a $46 billion spending plan for infrastructure, with the largest share going for electricity generation.Xi was originally scheduled to visit last September but Beijing cancelled the trip with Islamabad in the grip of major anti-government street protests.China has been a key financial and military ally of Islamabad over the years and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif secured promises of $42 billion worth of investment when he went to Beijing in November last year.Much of that centred on the energy sector -- Pakistan has wrestled with chronic power shortages in recent years that have scrubbed several points off GDP growth and inflicted misery on the everyday lives of its citizens.Pakistans foreign ministry said Thursday that a number of important agreements and memorandums of understanding would be signed during the visit, but gave no details.Liu said Xis visit would be the first by a Chinese president in nine years and stressed that it was his first overseas trip this year.""It is yet another major diplomatic action taken by Chinas top leader in Chinas neighbourhood,"" he said.He added that the trip will ""map out an overall plan for China-Pakistan relations and cooperation in various areas for the next five to 10 years and take bilateral relations to a new level.""",business

The move took effect Monday.""While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy than official comments previously indicated,"" said Brian Jackson, China economist at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action, prices retraced some gains after Saudi Arabias oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast for US inventories.""Its been choppy,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors, he said, are ""trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn"" in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape, showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.""There may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from the economies of the US, eurozone and China,"" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics.

"Milans Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italys deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since Shanghais groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the citys renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milans magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the countrys capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with Italys unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to Italys strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movements march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of Fridays demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expos critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.",business
"Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

"Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They would be better off to ""adjust gradually"" using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.",business

"President Barack Obama Thursday called US oil production an important source of energy as America transitions towards cleaner resources, defending his move to allow petroleum giant Shell to drill in the Alaskan Arctic.Obamas administration gave the petroleum giant a green light three days ago to explore the Chukchi Sea near Alaska -- as long as the Anglo-Dutch firm has the correct permits from the agencies that regulate the environment and marine mammal health.Environmental groups oppose the drilling due to the vulnerability of Arctic animals that are already struggling with melting sea ice and the risk that an oil spill would pose to the region.""Despite the fact that Shell had put in an application for exploration in this region several years ago, we delayed it for a very lengthy period of time, until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances that we have not seen before,"" Obama said during a Thursday press conference.Shell put its drilling plans for the Alaska Arctic on hold in 2013 following multiple embarrassing problems with its two rigs.One, the Kulluk, washed ashore after breaking loose from towing vessels in stormy seas in southern Alaska in January.Another, the Noble Discoverer, was recently cited by the US Coast Guard for numerous safety and operational deficiencies.Both rigs were sent to Asia for repair and maintenance work.""Shell had to go back to the drawing board, revamp its approach,"" Obama said.""I am working internationally to reduce our carbon emissions and to replace, over time, fossil fuels with clean energies,"" he added.""In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil fuels, and when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil and natural gas is important,"" Obama said.He added that importing oil and gas meant it might be ""purchased from places that have much lower environmental standards than we do.""Some Americans grew increasingly wary of drilling after the April 2010 explosion of BP-leased Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean.A Shell spokesman said that operations in the Chukchi Sea are scheduled to begin in the coming months.",business

He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan APP/Geo News",business

"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South Americas largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of Lis first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Lis host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the countrys tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South Americas first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Lis first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for Brazils state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a ""new intensity in our relations.""""China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,"" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to Chinas ""rich experience"" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing ""would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.""Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazils flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazils number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.Lis tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to Chinas Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazils Vale, the worlds biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazils main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Lis arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that ""a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,"" Rousseff told reporters.",business

"Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehrans nuclear programme.  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Irans nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the worlds fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP)",business

"China's tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of ""panic sentiment"" gripping investors.Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell-off, and the People's Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares.The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 6.8 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 5.9 percent.With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a buyer, blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the week bore the brunt.""I've never seen this kind of slump before. I don't think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,"" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities.""Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.""More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece.""Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note.

And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.""A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other ""stability measures"" have done little to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there had been a big increase in ""irrational selling"" of stocks.Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.""Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in their share prices,"" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie.",business
"The International Monetary Fund lowered its 2015 global economic growth forecast on Thursday, citing a likely ""temporary setback"" from the United States in the first months of the year.The IMF also highlighted the risk of ""financial stress"" in Europe from the Greek debt crisis and Chinas slowdown, but left forecasts for the eurozone and the Asian giant unchanged.The Washington-based institution projected the world economy would grow 3.3 percent this year, less than the 3.5 percent pace it had forecast in April and slightly slower than 2014. The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.""Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,"" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMFs chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.""The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lions share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,"" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the worlds largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. Canadas forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and Mexicos by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economys soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness ""now that the fog has largely cleared.""""Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,"" he said.Greeces debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).""Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,"" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed ""broadly on track"".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. ""Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,"" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.""The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,"" Blanchard said.""There is no particular reason to have lost confidence"" in Chinas economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the worlds number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin Americas largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.""The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,"" it said.",business

""So its a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.""""Now that its actually happened, people are buying back in,"" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Irans oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.""To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehrans stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Irans nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Irans nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPECs fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.""Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,"" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.""Irans oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,"" it noted.The ratings agency added: ""We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.""The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.""A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is ""interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Irans energy potential"".BP added in a statement: ""We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities once able to do so.""Lid on pricesLooking ahead, ""the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market"", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.""We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,"" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase.Irans OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq ""have both significantly ramped up production this year"", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.""There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,"" he told AFP.",business
"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector, in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.The first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15, the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued, the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit, and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last years level, could not match the outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from a robust growth in workers remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBPs liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year ago, enough to finance three months of the countrys import bill.The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decades low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing sectors (agriculture and industry), services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year.",business

"Gold fell back towards five-year lows on Wednesday as investors continued to pull away from the precious metal, with a slide through key chart levels earlier this week setting prices up for further losses.A looming rise in US interest rates, the first in nearly a decade, has dented gold's investment appeal, encouraging more sellers in the market after Monday's 3 percent rout, its biggest one-day drop since September 2013.Holdings in top gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining another 4.8 tonnes to hit their lowest since 2008.

""Gold prices are falling against the weaker dollar, declining equity markets -- those are clearly bad signs. Everything speaks against rising gold prices.""ETF investors are getting rid of their holdings, and it seems speculators are also continuing to sell. It's a perfect storm for gold,"" he said. ""Expectations about the developments of US interest rates are clearly an underlying trend.""Monday's selloff came on the back of huge volumes traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange after investors dumped more than $500 million of bullion in New York in four seconds during early Asian trading hours.That sparked a slide through key chart levels, triggering stop-loss orders that added to momentum.

"Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented  thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the countrys sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore  yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while ""Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan"".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest. ""There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants in Pakistan,"" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European cars dominated Pakistans roads in the early years after it gained independence from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the 1990s, while South Koreas Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried  and failed  to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900 in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistans roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistans booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachis share market among the worlds top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.""Pakistani automakers havent really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,"" Khan told AFP.""But given VWs impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.""",business

"Desperate to widen the tax base in a country where less then one percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers.

Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoCs move means it will now also take into account the previous days close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currencys value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before Tuesdays announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.",business

"In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015. Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return, he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. It will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time, he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBRs new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.",business

Brent crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brents September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling prices.""The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to pressure oil prices,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of an imminent US rate rise, after Chinas shock devaluation of the yuan last week hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.""The devaluation of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.""This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.""Gupta said traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for further clues on the health of the worlds second-largest economy.Traders will also comb through the minutes of the US central banks meeting in late July, due for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.""We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few months,"" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.",business
"BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and ""shareable"" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for ""strategic partnerships"" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the ""social news"" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.""Its a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,"" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeeds founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.""BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,"" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.""They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.""The investment follows Mondays announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat ""shareable"" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by Frances Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeeds finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed ""has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.""BuzzFeed ""is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,"" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often dont read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in ""native"" advertising, which includes ""sponsored"" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeeds executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean ""collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.""Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of ""unicorns,"" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU. And Vice Media last year secured some $500 million which boosted its valuation to a reported $2.5 billion.One of the largest digital-only news groups is the Huffington Post, whose future is uncertain after its parent company AOL was sold this year to telecom giant Verizon.",business
"Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the worlds top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the worlds biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the worlds top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.",business
"Global oil prices hit a new six and a half year low Thursday, nearing the key $40 a barrel level as a surprise rise in US stocks fuelled supply glut fears.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery sank to $40.21 per barrel, the lowest level since March 2009. It later stood at $40.30, down 50 cents from Wednesdays close.Brent North Sea crude for October delivery meanwhile slid to $46.31 a barrel, a point last seen in mid-January and not far off a six-year nadir. The contract later stood at $46.40, down 76 cents.""US stockpiles unexpectedly expanded when the market was looking at a contraction, which heightened the global oversupply concerns,"" said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG Markets.""This added pressure to crude prices, and we see WTI drop below $41, heading towards the key $40 level. We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions remain unfavourable to oil.""The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32 a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured by excess supplies.""Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015 begging the question how low can oil go,"" it said in a market commentary, adding that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel ""is a conceivable reality.""But Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in Thursdays trading session.""Technically, we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below $40 is going to be an arduous task,"" he said.""We see $40 for WTI to be a strong psychological support.""",business
"The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated a drive to identify income sources of luxurious vehicles owners to ensure their tax return filings, confiscating vehicles on non-compliance, official sources said on Thursday.The sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department.We are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities, said a source.The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used, especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income, said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles.Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy, the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest.Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs, the report said.Besides, many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.It will be difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario, said a source in the Inland Revenue.",business
"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday warned exchange companies on artificial shortage of the US currency that dropped rupee further to 104 against dollar amid a frenzy in the currency market.The artificial shortage of the US currency is a major source of concern, Abid Qamar, the chief spokesperson of SBP told The News. The State Bank is strictly monitoring the exchange rate movement in the open market and instructed the exchange companies heads that they should take necessary actions.Qamar said the central bank expressed its concerns over the falling rupee value in the open market despite that the bank has allowed exchange companies to import dollars to meet the growing demand for the greenback.(The central bank) has warned the exchange companies to make all-out efforts for curbing the US currency shortage in the market, he added.Qamar said recent move in the kerb dollar rate is really a source of worry for the central bank. The rising supply-demand gap is a source of worry.The rupee hit 104 against the US currency on Friday at the open market as dollar shortages continued. It was quoted 103.50/103.70 against the greenback.The rupee also breached its support level of 101 and closed at 102.02 versus dollar in the interbank market.The rupee has depreciated 3.5 percent since August 2014. The [interest] spread on buying and selling of the dollar between interbank and open markets has widened to Rs2. The State Bank has clearly instructed that the spread should not exceed 25 paisas.Malik Bostan, President Forex Association of Pakistan said the open currency market was volatile due to rise in dollar demand from Hajj pilgrims and imposition of 0.3 percent withholding tax on banking transactions for non-filers, who are now trading in dollar to avoid the tax.Hajj flights started from August 17 and will end next month. Therefore, Bostan said people have started buying dollar and Saudi Riyal for their journey.Meanwhile, the head of the central banks foreign exchange department, in a meeting with the representatives of exchange companies, directed them to bring stability in the kerb market by ensuring smooth supply of the foreign currencies.Bostan said the SBP ordered the exchange companies, during the meeting, to use biometric verification system in foreign exchange dealings for due diligence of the customer.The SBP said it would provide foreign exchange to the exchange companies to curb the shortage, Bostan claimed.It was also suggested that companies would not sell or buy single dollar without providing the CNIC (computerised national identity card) from the customer.",business
"Suddenly the online news business is red-hot. Money is flowing into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection from Comcasts NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200 million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club of ""unicorns,"" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.""Right now its an arms race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,"" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of ""millennials,"" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.""Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,"" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch familys 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.""Its as much a hedge as anything else,"" Doctor said.""Its a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.""Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, ""you can see the fault lines,"" Doctor said. ""Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.""The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.""BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,"" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means ""using data science to understand how information is spreading"" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcasts NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.""Were seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,"" she told AFP.""We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so Im sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.""For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.""These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,"" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.""We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,"" Layser said. ""We have not seen a magic bullet that is going to make a clear pathway to profitability.""",business

"Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about Chinas slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the worlds number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this years gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.""Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,"" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.""The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of Chinas economy) is inevitable.""Asias losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since Chinas shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even Beijings huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.""This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,"" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.""If we dont cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.""Oil prices also fell, after breaking below the $40 barrel for the first time in six years Friday on concerns about waning demand in China, the worlds top energy importer.Data showing the number of US drilling rigs rose last week, despite the slump in prices, added to concerns a global supply glut will last for years.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.28 to $39.58 while Brent crude for October eased $1.45 to $44.65.Jitters over China and the global economy saw traders drop the dollar and move into the yen -- a safe haven in times of turmoil and uncertainty -- while the currencies of Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea all hit fresh multi-year lows.The greenback fell to 121.23 yen in Asia Monday, down from 122.06 yen in New York Friday.

"Crude prices dived in Asia on Monday, with US oil hovering below the key $40 a barrel mark amid deepening concerns about weak Chinese economic growth and global oversupply, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for October delivery fell $1.04 to $39.41 while Brent crude for October eased 91 cents to $44.55 in late-morning trade.WTI extended losses after briefly dipping to $39.86 on Friday in New York -- breaking $40 for the first time in six years -- after data showed an increase in US oil rigs despite ample global supplies.""Soft manufacturing data from China and continued increase in weekly rig count led to the sharp sell-off"" in oil prices, said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at consultancy EY.The Baker Hughes US oil rig count showed producers in the worlds top crude consumer added two more rigs in the week to August 21, the same number as the previous week, bringing the overall tally of active drilling oil rigs to 674.A much weaker-than-expected manufacturing report on Friday also added to concerns energy demand is also waning in China.The Caixins Purchasing Managers Index came in at 47.1 this month, falling from 47.8 in July and its worst reading since March 2009. A reading below 50 signifies contraction in activity.The poor data fuelled concerns about the worlds second-largest economy and top energy importer -- already heightened by Beijings unexpected devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago -- at a time when high production levels and weak demand growth are weighing on prices.Oil dealers will next be scrutinising preliminary US second-quarter GDP data to be released on Thursday, analysts said.The data could be key to the Federal Reserves timeline for raising interest rates, with predictions for a September raise fading in the face of global growth jitters.Interest rate adjustments are closely watched by crude investors as an increase usually leads to a pick-up in the dollar.

"The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies, said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.The statement added that, Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities. SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.",business
"The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the governments ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement.

Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi.

The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.",business

"Pakistan is poised to fetch higher export orders for onion this year after India, its competitor, and Bangladesh returned to the international markets to overcome local shortage in supplies, traders have said.""Pakistan has registered an increase in demand from the overseas markets in the last couple of weeksIndia has recently started importing onion from Pakistan via the Wagah border,"" said Haji Shahjahan, an exporter.""Total export of the country would remain steady at 450,000 to 500,000 ton this year, which is similar to the previous year,"" he estimated. The countrys annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market. ""Supplies are sometimes slowed down when the crop finishes in one area and harvesting begins in other areas...These days, onions from Balochistan are available in the markets nationwide."" Sindh would begin harvesting the new crop from October, and will continue in full swing until November-December. The crop would last till April 2016.He, however, said Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and UAE remain the biggest importers of Pakistani onion.Attributing the price fluctuation to the demand supply gap, Shahjahan said Malaysia has been importing 50-60 containers (of 25 tons each) every week, UAE 40-50 containers, whereas Sri Lanka buys 30-40 containers of onion from Pakistan every week. ""On a weekly average, Pakistan exports 8,000 to 10,000 tons of onion,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Baloch, another exporter, said ""I have just received an export order from Bangladesh, and I am evaluating the export price.""Reportedly, Bangladesh usually imports onion from India. The export country {India}, however, is itself experiencing shortage in local supplies and price-hike these days. The situation has also convinced Bangladesh to divert its import orders to other countries.Pakistan, a common neighbour to both the countries, with a local production estimated at 2.5 million tons this year, may help them overcome a part of their local shortages.Egypt, Iran, an Afghanistan may also help them overcome the crises, it was learnt.Baloch added that Pakistan could fetch higher exports than the estimated amount if the government did not set a maximum limit per exporter. ""According to the rules, one exporter cannot load more than one container of onion in each vessel may be each vessel carries 100 containers.""Shahjahan added two to three vessels of onions leave the Karachi Port every week.",business
"A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the countrys main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.No one from governments side came forward to negotiate with us, he said.We have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime Ministers secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.Even various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agents leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses, he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace, he said. And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didnt issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders dont work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said governments non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The countrys exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didnt seriously take the issue. It was only after 12 days, during which traders sustained huge losses the government came for negotiation with the protestors.He said the present government allows an issue to blow out of proportion before coming for the rescue.Fawad Ijaz Khan, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the government has failed to resolve the issues facing freight forwarders and air cargo agents.We have been trying to contact the various ministries, including finance and commerce ministries, but no one was available to listen to our grievances, Khan said.Our members are worried about their consignments and their orders might be cancelled if not shipped on time.Shabbir Ahmed, former chairman of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association said the government should seriously take notice of the matter and immediately resolve the issues of the logistics sector.

"Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the worlds biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economys most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as Chinas booming economy began to slow, oils price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPECs response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised Japans nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in Irans atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.",business

This compared with a fall of 8.9 percent in July.Imports dropped 14.3 percent, from an 8.6 percent decrease in July.""This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP.""Chinas economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,"" he added.The data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the worlds second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth.Oil prices have come under pressure from concerns that Chinas slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels.Oil prices are down almost 30 percent from this years closing peak in May, according to Bloomberg News data.Analysts said dealers would next scrutinise the latest weekly US petroleum report due Thursday, a day later than usual due to a holiday on Monday.US crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak due to high production levels despite tepid demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.",business

"Dubai property developers are still turning out some larger-than-life projects even though prices are heading south again after clawing back a good chunk of their losses in the 2008 crash.  The Gulf emirates annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by whats going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  ""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the worlds highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the worlds tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break Dubais own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.  Dubais Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said Dubais market has ""matured"" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.",business
"Traders and business community is observing countrywide complete shutter down strike, halting business activities today (Wednesday) against the imposition of withholding tax on all types of banking transactions.This would be the second countrywide strike on the same issue. Earlier, the business community succeeded in observing the strike across country, pressurising the Federal Board of Revenue to halve the rate of withholding tax on banking transactions, and extending the date of implementation of the said tax.However, a faction of traders refused the FBR incentive, sticking to their single point agenda of withdrawal of the withholding tax from banking transactions, which has compelled the other groups to join hands with them and show their muscle power to the government.On Tuesday, different factions of the traders in two different press conferences announced the complete shutter down strike for today. They said that after this strike, they will announce their future plans of protests and strikes which would be for an indefinite period.They said that businessmen had never refused to pay taxes, but the government instead of taxing those who were already in the net, should bring new people in to the tax net.They said that this tax had not only made life of the traders miserable, but also destroyed the whole banking sector, as it was now facing a collective loss of Rs878 billion.After the traders and business community, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also announced to observe the September 9 strike.",business

"A mixed reading on Chinese inflation Thursday kept Asian equities traders on edge in fresh volatility Thursday as markets retreated from a two-day rally, while fears of a US interest rate hike saw safe assets advance.Early selling spread through regional exchanges, with Hong Kong and Shanghai seeing hefty losses, despite Chinese Premier Li Keqiang the day before seeking to shore up confidence in the governments handling of an economic crisis that has sent global markets plunging.A late tumble on Wall Street provided extra reason to run after a report showing a tighter US jobs market increased speculation the Federal Reserve will pull the trigger on a rate rise at next weeks policy meeting.Thursdays losses follow thumping gains across the world over the previous two days -- including a 7.7 percent jump in Tokyo Wednesday -- which were helped by Chinese moves to bolster its economy.However, Nader Naeimi, head of dynamic asset allocation at AMP Capital Investors Ltd. in Sydney, told Bloomberg News: ""Markets will remain volatile until the Fed meeting next week.""Investors are again focusing on the potential US interest rate increase and how it would impact emerging markets.""In Beijing, official figures showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose two percent last month, better than Julys 1.6 percent and beating forecasts of 1.8 percent.However, the producer price index (PPI) -- a crucial measure of costs for goods at the factory gate and a leading indicator of the trend for consumer prices -- slumped at its fastest rate in six years.The figures will do little to ease the struggle authorities have in kickstarting the worlds number two economy and main driver of global growth as it suffers a painful slowdown.""This is a real problem,"" said Zhu Qibing, a Beijing-based analyst at China Minzu Securities Co.

"Asian markets were relatively calm Friday at the end of a volatile week, with Shanghai and Hong Kong ticking higher after China unveiled a series of steps to shore up its economy, but fears of a US interest rate hike kept dealers on edge.Higher-yielding, or riskier, currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won benefited from a more upbeat outlook, which followed a positive lead from Wall Street, while the Australian dollar edged higher.The safe-haven yen, considered a go-to asset in times of turmoil, retreated.Analysts said world markets seemed to be settling after a roller-coaster ride since China last month devalued its yuan currency, sparking concerns about the worlds number two economy -- the main driver of global growth -- and its leaders ability to control the crisis.The broadly upbeat sentiment comes after Beijing sought to reassure investors it was able to maintain high growth, and announced a plan to speed up major construction projects and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises.A set of capital controls to prevent a flight of cash were implemented this week, while analysts said a rise in the offshore yuan Thursday suggested the central bank had intervened to prop it up.Authorities also unveiled a series of measures to prevent huge swings in Chinas stock markets, which have seen trillions of dollars wiped off valuations in Shanghai since it hit a peak in mid-June. Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next weeks Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Streets three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275.And the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents.The ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent.

"The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning, reads a Nepras decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development, the authority said.In short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.The authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability, read the ruling.An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.",business

The report also said US oil production fell for the sixth straight week.""For the oil market, the fact that US oil production was down once again may perhaps be even more relevant than the decline in stocks,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.""This would appear to prove OPECs strategy correct, namely that low oil prices would prompt shale oil producers to abandon production. In fact, this trend may well even accelerate in the near future.""World oil prices have roughly halved in value since a year ago, plagued by a global supply glut caused largely by cheaper production of US oil following extraction from shale rock.Attention is now focused on Washington where the Fed will make an announcement on borrowing costs, with analyst opinion split on whether it will begin lift-off of raising rates on Thursday or wait until December.Fed chief Janet Yellen has said she expects an increase in US interest rates by the end of the year but recent turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about Chinas economy have complicated policymakers decision-making.A rise in US interest rates tends to bolster the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand.",business

"A plunge in a gauge of Chinese factory activity stoked fresh fears about the worlds number two economy and the global outlook Wednesday, sending Asian markets tumbling after a heavy sell-off in New York and Europe.Emerging market currencies -- already under pressure from an expected US interest rate hike and weak growth -- also took a battering as investors rushed into lower-yielding, or safer, assets such as the yen while oil prices eased.The losses extended a general downward spiral across the world as dealers fret over the state of the global economy, with a US recovery offset by China posting growth at 25-year lows, and Japan and the eurozone also struggling.On Wednesday Chinas closely watched Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) of manufacturing activity for September came in at a six-and-a-half-year low and showed the sector contracted further.The preliminary reading released by financial publisher Caixin came in at 47.0, down from August and missing expectations of 47.5.

"Asian markets mostly recovered Thursday from the previous days sharp losses but Tokyo tumbled as investors returned from a long weekend to play catch-up, with auto giants hit by the Volkswagen scandal.The dollar edged up against most emerging market currencies ahead of a closely watched speech later in the day by Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, during which markets hope she will provide more clarity on the banks plans for an interest rate hike.Stocks and other high-yielding, or riskier, assets took a hit after the Feds decision last week to hold -- citing Chinas woes and a developing market slowdown -- fanned concerns about the US and global economy.Those worries were exacerbated Wednesday when a closely watched gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity for September hit a six-and-a-half-year low, the latest ion in a string of results highlighting a severe slowdown in the worlds number two economy.The news sent shares in Asia plunging -- with Shanghai and Hong Kong down more than two percent -- followed by losses in New York.On Thursday, however, investors in most stock markets turned buyers, with Shanghai up 0.75 percent, Sydney adding one percent and Seoul 0.42 percent higher. However, Hong Kong continued to drop, shedding 0.44 percent.Tokyo tumbled 2.34 percent by lunch as trading began for the first time since Friday owing to a three-day public holiday.""Japanese markets have still got some catch up to do after the uncertainty thats been washing through global markets,"" Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities in Sydney, said.""The issue is gauging the extent of the slowdown in China and the ongoing debate about whether the Fed is doing the right thing"" on when to raise interest rates.",business
"Oil prices fell in Asia Monday as investors looked for further clues about the health of the Chinese and US economies, the worlds top crude consumers.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery eased 48 cents to $45.22 and Brent crude for November dipped 47 cents to $48.13.Markets were rocked last week by news that a key gauge of manufacturing activity in China fell to a six-and-a-half-year low in September, the latest sign of slowdown in growth for the worlds second-biggest economy.""For most commodities, a hard landing in China would be a far greater threat than a gradual tightening from the Fed,"" research firm Capital Economics said.It said that the manufacturing data is likely to improve over the remainder of the year.The US Federal Reserve held off raising interest rates during its September meeting, but on Thursday Fed chief Janet Yellen said she still expects a lift-off this year and that concerns about weaker global growth likely will not affect that plan.Focus this week ""is likely to remain on China and particularly the equity market, which has recently shown signs of stabilising, and on the US ahead of the employment report on Friday"", Capital Economics said in a market commentary.A rise in interest rates would likely boost the US currency, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand.Prices are also under pressure owing to the prospect of Iranian oil returning to the oversupplied market following a landmark nuclear deal with major world powers reached in July.Under the agreement, the west will lift crippling economic sanctions if Iran curbs its nuclear ambitions, allowing the country to increase its oil exports. Tehran has denied western claims it is aiming to build an atomic bomb.Prices are expected to be volatile during the week, analysts said.""With no major economic data announcements during the week except for the US unemployment rate due next Friday, crude oil prices will continue to seesaw,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.

"Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies (Discos) by up to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent in 2004 in the power tariff, inflicting a loss of Rs2.1 billion per annum, reveals the governments official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF, a copy of which is available with The News.Under the circular debt management plan, the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs314 billion (as of end of June 2015) to Rs212 billion by financial year ending June 30, 2018 while keeping within the target of 0.4 percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector (about Rs128 billion) and 4 percent fiscal deficit. At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule. Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner. For the Discos not privatized, the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service.",business

"Air France's human resources manager had his shirt stripped from him as he was ""almost lynched"" on Monday by workers protesting at a plan to cut 2,900 jobs from the struggling airline.Bosses were unveiling a revamped restructuring plan after pilots rejected an earlier proposal to work longer hours. But the board meeting was cut short when hundreds of striking workers stormed into the airlines headquarters in Roissy, outside Paris.Human resources manager Xavier Broseta ""was almost lynched"", according to one union delegate, and had his shirt ripped off as he clambered over barriers to escape, helped by security guards. CEO Frederic Gagey also made a hasty exit, and the board said the meeting would not resume on Monday.The management condemned the ""physical violence"", and said it would file complaints to the police. Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the violence was ""unacceptable"". ""They do nothing to advance the search for a solution for Air France,"" he said in a statement.The loss-making airline, which employs 52,000 people, is struggling in the face of fierce competition from global rivals.It had tried to convince pilots, who earn up to 250,000 euros ($280,000) a year, to fly 100 more hours annually for the same salary, but talks broke down last week with pilots saying the plan amounted to an effective pay cut. The French government, which owns a 17.6-percent stake, has criticised the pilots, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls denouncing their ""hardline"" attitude.""If Air France does not evolve then it puts itself in danger,"" Valls said at the weekend.- Spectators to a crash -Four unions announced a strike to coincide with Mondays meeting. It was not clear how many staff were taking part, but the airline said flights would be unaffected beyond some check-in delays. Not all staff support the pilots, who also led a record-long strike a year ago that cost the company nearly half a billion euros.""Ground staff, stewards and hostesses feel they have made enormous efforts without ending up in a position to influence decisions,"" Beatrice Lestic, of the CFDT union, told Le Parisien newspaper. ""They are now spectators to a crash in which they will be the first victims,"" she said.Seeking to sharpen its competitive edge against main European rivals Lufthansa and British Airways-Iberia, the managements new proposals include ending five long-haul routes, reducing the frequency of other flights, and selling 14 planes over the next two years.Although the company says it favours voluntary departures, Gagey has indicated compulsory redundancies may be necessary for the first time, ""otherwise we would not make hoped-for progress in terms of productivity"".Sources at Mondays meeting said the plan includes the possibility of dismissing 300 pilots, 900 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,700 ground staff. The company already shed 5,500 posts via voluntary departures between 2012 and 2014 as it battled competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines. Pilots were also behind a record-long two-week strike in September 2014, which knocked 416 million euros off turnover and was described as ""catastrophic for the French aviation sector"" in a joint statement from key industry unions.The striking pilots opposed the expansion of Air Frances low-cost subsidiary Transavia.Air France, which merged with Dutch national carrier KLM in 2004, is trying to cut costs over two years by 1.8 billion euros.A source close to the deal told AFP Monday that as part of its cost-cutting plan, Air France is to enter into discussions about cancelling all or some of the Boeing 787s it has on order.The airline ordered 25 of the 787-9 Dreamliners in 2011.The source said: ""We are going to contact our suppliers from tomorrow to ask them if possible to cancel the scheduled delivery of the 787 planes.""Discussions will be opened and they could end in cancellations, thats our approach.""",business

The hard-won deal to create the worlds largest free-trade area, encompassing 40 percent of the global economy, came after five days of round-the-clock talks in an Atlanta hotel.President Barack Obama, who made the TPP a priority of his second term, said the accord reached in Georgia ""reflects Americas values and gives our workers the fair shot at success they deserve."" ""When more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we cant let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,"" Obama said in a statement. ""We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment.""More than 18,000 taxes imposed by various countries on US products will be eliminated thanks to the partnership, he added. - Shape the future -The accord involves significant market openings from Canada, the United States and Japan but also sets controversial new patent standards for cutting-edge biologic drugs and demands countries like Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia improve labor standards.""This agreement in my view is truly transformational,"" said Canada Trade Minister Ed Fast.""The magnitude and importance of rules for 21st century issues cant be underscored enough.... It will shape the future for many trade agreements in this 21st century."" The talks went four days past deadline to resolve conflicts over Canada and Japan opening up their dairy markets to New Zealand exports, and objections from Australia, Peru and Chile to the US push for longer biologic patent protections.Trade ministers said the landmark deal addresses new issues like data trade, foreign investment protections and intellectual property that have not been covered in multilateral trade pacts of the past. New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said his side of the talks went to 5 am Monday morning before an agreement was set.The deal is ""profoundly important and beneficial to the generations of people in our respective countries,"" he said.The accord still must be signed and ratified by the respective countries, which also include Singapore and Brunei.In Canada, facing a national election in two weeks, and in the United States, with elections coming in one year, that could prove particularly difficult.US members of Congress have already warned that they will not ratify any deal that gives up too much in US interests.Powerful Senator Orrin Hatch warned Monday that he will scour the deal ""to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congresss criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers.""",business
"Oil extended gains in Asia Monday as a decline in US drilling pointed to a slowdown in production, but concerns over demand remain after a disappointing US jobs report.A report from Baker Hughes Inc. said the number of active rigs in the United States fell by 26 to 614 last week, the lowest in five years, helping ease concerns over the global crude oversupply that has depressed prices.But poor unemployment data from the US continued to weigh on the market.The US Labor Department said Friday that jobs growth in the worlds biggest economy and top oil consumer faltered in September and the labour market weakened across the board.This has stoked concerns about demand for the commodity at a time when the Chinese economy is also slowing down amid a crude supply glut, analysts said.The US economy added a disappointing 142,000 jobs during the month, well below analyst estimates of 205,000 and the August jobs level of 173,000 was revised sharply lower to 136,000, surprising analysts.The July number also was lowered, bringing the average for the past three months to 167,000 jobs, lagging behind the 200,000-plus growth trend seen earlier in the year and in 2014.The unemployment rate, measuring those without work but actively seeking jobs, was unchanged as expected at 5.1 percent, the lowest level since 2008.The jobs data suggested that the US economy was being affected by the China-driven global slowdown and market volatility.In morning Asia trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was up 11 cents to $45.65 and Brent crude for November jumped 15 cents to $48.28 a barrel.Both contracts also rose on Friday after a decline in US oil drilling bolstered hopes of lower production to ease the global oversupply.""The disappointing US jobs report for September will clearly do little to improve investor confidence in the global economy,"" research house Capital Economics said.""Yes, it will probably delay the first interest rate hike from the Fed until early next year.""Analysts had predicted the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates either this month or in December after policymakers held back during a meeting in September.The Fed has said the timing of a rate increase will depend on the health of the US economy.",business

"Buoyant oil prices sustained a rally in Asia Wednesday driven by hopes the crude supply glut would ease and expectations the US central bank would hold off from raising interest rates.A softening of the US currency also helped bolster prices as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of weaker units, spurring demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery rose 55 cents to $49.08 and Brent crude for November advanced 40 cents to $52.32 a barrel in late-morning trade.Prices fell to six-year lows in August on strong production from the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but have since crept higher.The recent rally began last week after data showed a drop in US drilling activity, raising hopes this would help ease the oversupply.The US Department of Energy has forecast production to decline to an average of 8.9 million barrels per day next year from 9.2 million in 2015.Expectations that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would not raise interest rates this year because of the weak global economy also boosted oil prices, analysts said.""We no longer look for lift-off until the first quarter of 2016.

"Erratic monsoon rains have made it increasingly hard for rice farmer Sardar Muhammad to bring in a good harvest. But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields  rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province  is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.",business

"Oil fell in Asia Monday after official data showed Chinas economy posted its slowest growth for more than six years in the third quarter, reinforcing worries about demand from the worlds top energy guzzler.The government said gross domestic product (GDP) for the worlds second-biggest economy rose 6.9 percent in the three months to September, beating market forecasts but still the worst since 2009.Growth in Chinas industrial production, which measures output at factories, workshops and mines, also dropped sharply to 5.7 percent year-on-year in September, the government said.""Although Chinas retail sales turned out strong, industrial related data remained weak. This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears. US data has not been exceptionally strong, and thus, could mean that oil prices could be facing some headwinds towards the end of the week,"" Ang said.In Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was down 10 cents to $47.16 and Brent crude for December fell 12 cents to $50.34 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.Both contracts fell for four straight trading days last week before advancing Friday on the back of data showing a fresh decline in US oil exploration, which suggested lower output that could help ease the global oversupply.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said the market will also be seeking clues from a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC technical experts in Vienna on Wednesday.Oil-producer Russia said last week it was prepared to discuss output cuts during the meeting.",business

"Oil prices edged up in Asia Thursday, lifted by bargain-hunting following a sharp decline the day before, although analysts said the market remains hobbled by an oversupply of the commodity.A report released Wednesday showing a bigger-than-expected increase in US crude stockpiles has stoked fresh worries about a global glut that has depressed oil prices for more than a year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December rose 25 cents to $45.45 and Brent crude for December climbed 21 cents to $48.06 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.The rebound followed Wednesdays steep fall after the US Energy Information Administration said the countrys commercial crude-oil inventories jumped by eight million barrels to 476.6 million in the week ending October 16.The increase, which typically indicates weaker demand in the worlds number one economy, was more than double market expectations.Oil prices took a hit at the start of the week when China said gross domestic product grew in the third quarter at its slowest pace in more than six years.""Worries about the health of the Chinese economy continue to batter commodities prices. In the US, crude stockpiles surged ... and supply glut remains a concern,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.Gupta said a meeting between OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers on Wednesday ""did not produce any meaningful results as no potential production cuts were addressed"".Russia had said it was prepared to discuss a reduction with members of the cartel at the meeting in Vienna.Gupta said the market will be looking at a December 4 policy-setting meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries which is expected to ""provide vital clues about price development in the medium term"".OPEC, which includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, has maintained high production levels despite the oil price decline, as members seek to maintain market share.",business
"Asian stocks on Monday were close to wiping out all their losses since Chinas shock currency devaluation in August, as global equities rallied after the Chinese central bank cut rates and US tech giants provided upbeat earnings guidance.MSCIs index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent to hit its highest since Aug. 12, led by 1.2 percent gains in Honk Kong. Japans Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to a two-month high.The surprise move by China lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursdays message from the European Central Bank that it stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates to even deeper negative levels.""These moves by the ECB and China are raising speculation that the Bank of Japan will act later on this week as well,"" Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Friday.The US Federal Reserve is also widely expected to refrain from raising rates at its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.Against these backdrop, the MSCI's index of the world's share markets shot up to its highest level since Aug. 20, having risen more than 10 percent from its two-year low hit less than a month ago.It has recovered most of the losses since Aug. 11, when China's sudden devaluation of the yuan sparked worries its economy may be in deeper trouble than many had thought.On Wall Street, S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to turn positive on the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent.Technology shares led the way, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported earnings results. The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.Mainland Chinese shares rose on Monday after China cut the benchmark one-year lending rate - for the sixth time in less than a year - by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent, and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio late.Gains were fairly limited, however, with Shanghai composite index up just 0.5 percent.Naoki Tashiro, the president of TS China Research, noted that in the week following each of the past year's five rate mainland shares rose three times but fell twice.""Mainland investors are cautious. The market has been rallying so far this month, so some investors could may well take profits into rally,"" he said.One big focus is Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a new five-year plan, while investors attempt to gauge how much China's growth is likely to slow in coming years.Ahead of the central committee meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.Risk sentiment supported by Thursday's message from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing.That saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them.The benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.As negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989 in early Asian trade. It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.""The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound. Markets are now expecting easing from the BOJ,"" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank.Despite a recovery in global equity prices, oil prices were softer, pressured by ongoing oversupply worries.Brent futures stood at $44.68, hardly recovering after a fall of 5.6 percent last week, not far from three-week low of $44.20 touched on Friday.",business
"STRASBOURG, FRANCE: European lawmakers on Tuesday approved an end to loathed mobile phone roaming charges in the EU by 2017 and adopted rules to ensure open internet access.""This abolition of roaming surcharges has been long awaited by everybody: ordinary people, start-ups, SMEs and all kinds of organisations,"" said Pilar del Castillo, the Spanish MEP who helped steer the legislation through the European Parliament.Roaming charges vary enormously between telecoms operators and many users have ended up paying exorbitant rates -- often without knowing in advance -- to make calls when travelling within the 28-nation European Union.Also included in the telecoms package were rules to ensure what is known as ""net neutrality,"" meaning unfettered access to the Internet, although critics said they do not go far enough.Earlier this year, the US telecoms regulator put in place ""open Internet"" rules to prevent operators offering different rates of access depending on fees or the services offered.The EU rules are largely the same but they do offer some leeway to operators to market different services. ""Thanks to this agreement, Europe will also become the only region in the world which legally guarantees open internet and net neutrality,"" del Castillo told parliament in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.""The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in the 28 member states. It also ensures that we will not have a two-speed internet,"" she said in a parliament statement.Critics said both measures were welcome but more should be done, especially on internet access.Monique Goyens, head of the European Consumer Organisation, said that while ""access to the open Internet is now a legal right for all EU consumers ... deficiencies remain.""",business

"The Pakistani rupee on Wednesday slipped to a fresh two-year low of 105.80 against the US dollar in the interbank market, falling 56 paisa from its previous closing. In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country. Currency dealers say the growing demand is due to oil-related payments.""There were a few import payments in the market and banks were already short of them, and as the rupee crossed the 104.50 level it triggered 'stop', surging the rupee past the 105 figure,"" Eman Khan from Tresmark, an application that tracks financial markets, told The News on Tuesday. ""It's no coincidence that it happened on a day when the Finance minister initiated meeting with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and also when economic managers are assessing the damage from the deadly earthquake,"" Khan said.

"Oil prices tumbled in Asia Thursday, cutting short a rally the day before after hints of an interest rate hike in December by the US Federal Reserve boosted the dollar.Prices rose Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said the countrys commercial crude stockpiles had increased less than expected, suggesting stronger demand in the worlds top oil consuming nation.But the rebound was punctured after the Fed on Wednesday signalled it could raise rates before the end of the year, expressing optimism for the worlds top economy after ""solid"" consumer spending and business investment.""With the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rates hikes on Wednesday, the market will keep watch on the December meeting where a rate hike is likely in play,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.At around 0330 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 16 cents lower at $45.78 and Brent crude for December was down 21 cents at $48.84.US oil prices jumped more than six percent in Wednesdays session after news domestic crude supplies rose less than expected in the week ending October 23.The news helped ease some fears over a glut of world supplies that experts warn could last well into next year, which has seen oil prices more than halve from last years highs.But the rally was cut short when the US central bank explicitly pointed to the possibility of a rate hike in its next meeting in December, dampening market predictions it could be held off until March.The news pushed the dollar higher -- an interest rate hike is bullish for the dollar as it attracts investors to the currency in the quest for higher returns.But because oil is traded in dollars, a strong US currency will make the commodity more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand and prices.""We are still expecting the Fed rate normalisation to be an eventuality and the latest Federal Open Market Committee decision further reaffirms our expectation for the first hike (since 2006) to take place in the 15-16 December 2015 FOMC (meeting),"" United Overseas Bank said.",business

"Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the countrys economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the governments commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central banks accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sectors loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moodys Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moodys forecasts Pakistans real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation  a result of weaker profitability.Moodys expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the markets perception of Pakistans risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moodys expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets  defined as cash and bank placements  at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.",business
"Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Wednesday, with global crude oversupply continuing to dampen investors sentiment despite occasional rallies.Prices had risen the previous day after a four-day losing streak, as traders weighed a bearish price outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a lowered US estimate for crude production.The oil market has collapsed by more than half since mid-2014 with prices languishing under $50 a barrel, hurt by the supply glut and the decision by the oil exporter grouping OPEC to maintain output to counter booming US shale production.The Paris-based IEA, in a report Tuesday, forecast that the global oil market would recover to $80 a barrel by 2020.At around 0300 GMT Wednesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 47 cents lower at $43.74 and Brent crude for December was down 26 cents at $47.18.""We continue to think the market will remain in surplus through most of 2016, which is likely to restrict the upside for prices, particularly over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said in a market commentary.A strong dollar, fuelled by widening expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, has also been keeping a lid on prices.Oil is traded in the US currency and a buoyant dollar would make the commodity more expensive for those holding weaker units, lowering demand and prices.""We expect the greenback to continue to be supported as we approach the likely lift-off in rates,"" Singapores United Overseas Bank said, referring to a December 17 meeting of the Feds policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.",business

"ANTALYA: Turkey has cancelled a multi-billion-dollar deal with China to build its first anti-missile system that had alarmed Ankaras allies in NATO, a Turkish official said on Sunday.""The deal was cancelled,"" the official from Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglus office told AFP. ""One of the main reasons is that we will launch our own national missile project,"" added the official.The news came as Turkey hosted key Western allies including US President Barack Obama but also Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the summit of G20 top economies in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.Turkey entered negotiations in 2013 with the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC) to finalise a contract worth $3.4 billion (3 billion euros).French-Italian consortium Eurosam and US-listed Raytheon Co had also submitted offers but the government had prioritised talks with the Chinese company, which raised serious concerns over the compatibility of CPMIECs systems with NATO missile defences.NATO has said missile systems within the alliance must be compatible with each other while calling on Turkey to take this factor into account.Turkish government sources said an official announcement was expected next week. A second Turkish official said the issue of technology transfer was one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Chinese company.""They refused to give what we demanded,"" the official told AFP, without elaborating. ""The talks were blocked at some point.""Although the governments current plans to build Turkish-made missile defence system, it was not immediately clear if Ankara would launch talks with the European and American contenders.Washington was particularly irked by Turkish decision to negotiate with the Chinese company, which has been hit by a series of US sanctions for selling arms and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.Turkey in the past made confusing comments over its lucrative tender, with a government minister saying the Chinese company was the winner and that its system could be used without integrating with NATO systems.But a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had insisted that the missile system would be harmonious and integrated with NATO defence architecture.",business

" State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.",business

"The government has old wine to offer in a new bottle to appease both the IMF and the traders in its bid to broaden the tax base. The strategy, however, offers no promise to arrest the flow of smuggled goods, one of the key reasons for the undocumented economy. The tax amnesty scheme for whitening black money of traders will be treated as regularisation of money as the IMF is opposed to any kind of amnesty. The government sees no other option to bring traders in the tax net, according to a well-placed official. Compared to past amnesty schemes, this measure will be for traders only. Although the government has taken a bold decision of daring traders community, the constituency of the ruling party, the current scheme lacks any strategy for checking the smuggled items that are available at cheap rates but without any invoicing, generating a chain of undocumented income and tax evasion at multiple level.It is hard to fix all issues at once but we are trying to raise the cost of undocumented business through taxing banking transactions, said an official privy to the ongoing deliberations when asked about the challenges to economy from the smuggled goods.Instead, the government is more focused on bringing the traders into the tax net by exempting them from tax audit at least for three-year allowing them declare their hidden assets and bank accounts, and in return they will gradually increase their tax payments during the amnesty period.We have reminded traders that the era of benami transactions is going to be over soon, said a tax official with reference to the legislation being drafted for tabling in Parliament early next year suggesting heavy penalty for offenders.The government will grant amnesty to the traders having undeclared assets if the declarations are made in the tax return and such return filers continue increasing their tax payment by 25% during the financial years exempted from scrutiny.Unlike the complicated tax return form for the regular taxpayers, one-page tax return is being designed for the traders in English and Urdu both benefiting from this scheme in order to facilitate their entry into the tax net.Another issue regarding the sales tax on the turnover is also being reduced from one percent to 0.25% in order to settle down long-standing dispute between the FBR and the traders. The traders have been objecting turnover on the total cost of product instead of total sale.Among other measures to address their concerns, regional-level committees of traders have been formed for meetings with the regional tax commissioners to discuss ways and means for ironing out differences.Right now, the government is in contact with two groups of traders headed by Khalid Pervez and Naeem Mir, both are Lahore-based.The former is said to be non-cooperative as he tends to politicise the entire issues even the tax notices that he received months ago alleging him of mis-declaration of bank accounts and assets.In tax year 2013, he declared a book shop in Urdu Bazara as his only business in addition to foreign remittances of four millions rupees and property income of three millions and paid tax Rs49,992, according to an FBR official. This was in contrast with the six undeclared bank accounts and plots as well as eight vehicles spotted by the FBR forming basis of issuing him a notice.Naeem Mir, on the other hand, has been cooperative and urging the government to launch an awareness campaign in order to counter the false propaganda, address their legitimate concerns in addition to educating traders about the benefits of being in the tax net.",business

"World oil prices rose this week on concerns that heightened geopolitical tensions could disrupt Middle East supplies despite a market awash with crude.Traders were turning their attention to next weeks OPEC output meeting to see if the oil producers cartel will slash high output levels.The 12-nation OPEC, which counts the worlds biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia among its members as well as Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, holds a regular meeting in Vienna on December 4.Most analysts expect the cartel to stick to its decision taken at the last meeting in June, when OPEC defied calls to cut output despite sliding oil prices, so extending its strategy of preserving market share and fending off competition from the US shale energy boom.Keeping the status quo would see the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries official production target left at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for four years -- following pressure from cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia on the other members.""We continue to believe that there will not be any change in Saudi or OPEC policy"" in Vienna, noted Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner.""Oil market oversupply will continue through next year, due to resilient US production -- even if it is declining -- high OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the gradual return of Iran starting in"" 2016, he added.OPEC member Iran last week said it would not negotiate with the cartel over a planned half million barrels per day oil production hike once sanctions are lifted.Despite a supply glut that has caused crude prices to more than halve over the past 18 months -- due primarily to high output from US shale rock but also owing to weaker Chinese demand -- Iran has consistently said it plans to up its output when nuclear-related sanctions are lifted under a deal agreed in July with world powers.Downward pressure on the oil market this week was meanwhile capped by the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.But reports that Russia is not taking military action against Turkey in retaliation eased fears that the tense situation in the region could escalate and disrupt Middle East oil supplies.Moscow said retaliatory measures would focus on using its leverage to tighten the screws on Turkeys economy, including halting joint economic projects.Next week will see traders monitoring also the meeting of the Federal Reserve, when policymakers are expected to lift US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. A hike would likely boost the dollar, making oil priced in the US unit more expensive for holders of weaker currencies.By late Friday in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in January edged higher to $44.93 a barrel from $44.66 a barrel one week earlier.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January stood at $42.02 a barrel compared with $40.39 for the expired December contract one week earlier.",business
"Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistans three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of Decembers approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didnt do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistans import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.",business
"Oil prices traded below $42 in Asia Monday ahead of an OPEC meeting and the release of data on Chinas important manufacturing sector later in the week.The market will be watching whether members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which meets on December 4, slash currently high output levels and ease a crude supply glut that has depressed prices for more than a year.Analysts said traders will also tune in to two key speeches by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen this week for signs on the timing of a hike in US interest rates.November data on Chinas industrial sector is released on Tuesday, with traders looking for clues on the health of the worlds top energy consumer.At around 0230 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up 10 cents to $41.81 and Brent crude for January was trading five cents lower at $44.81 a barrel.""We expect the focus to return to the timing of the US interest rate rise, with two key speeches by Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, on Wednesday and Thursday,"" Capital Economics said in a market commentary.Analysts expect Fed policymakers to raise interest rates during their December meeting, a move that will boost the dollar and make dollar-priced oil more expensive, denting demand and prices.OPECs Friday meeting is expected to focus on the global crude oversupply, the return of Iranian oil to the market after the lifting of western economic sanctions and whether the cartel will cut production to boost prices.""However, comments from key OPEC ministers still seem relatively sanguine. Also, it is not clear that even if OPEC did cut its production target, actual output would fall, given the cartel is already producing well above its current target,"" Capital Economics said.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said the OPEC meeting would ""draw attention on supply and demand in the next year"".",business
"Oil prices rose in Asia Tuesday, three days before an OPEC meeting in which the cartel is expected to maintain high output levels despite a global supply glut.Analysts say the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to focus more on maintaining market share against competitors than on slashing production in order to lift prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up 29 cents to $41.94 and Brent crude for January was trading 18 cents higher at 44.79 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.""Crude oil remained on the soft side as many expect OPEC to be unwaving about its production target when the group gathers this Friday,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""Crude prices are likely to stay sideways ahead of the OPEC meeting, where Iran is expected to announce plans to expand output.""Iran is expected to increase its oil exports after crippling western sanctions are lifted under a landmark deal reached with major world powers in July to curb its nuclear programme.The sanctions have restricted Iranian oil shipments and analysts say their return to the market will further add to the crude oversupply.Irans deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said last week his country expects the deal to come into force in early January, when Tehran will have implemented its commitments.Oil prices have been in retreat from levels above $100 a barrel reached in mid-2014, with the decline accelerating after OPECs November 2014 meeting signalled the group would keep output high.A key measure of Chinas manufacturing activity dropped to its weakest level in more than three years in November, data released Tuesday showed, further underlining weaknesses in the worlds top energy consumer.The official Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which tracks activity in the crucial factories and workshops sector, fell to 49.6, the government statistics bureau said.

"Asian markets saw fresh volatility Wednesday, with Shanghai seeing sharp swings, as weak factory activity data highlighted weakness in the global economy but fuelled hopes central banks will stick to a loose monetary policy.The euro also held its own after rallying in New York as a surprisingly positive set of eurozone figures raised the possibility the European Central Bank will delay an expected stimulus boost.Official figures showing a gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity hit a three-year low in November was followed later in the day by news that US factory work contracted at the fastest pace since June 2009.While the US economy, the worlds biggest, has shown strong signs it is well on track to recovery, traders remain nervous about the future, with commodity prices at multi-year lows and the dollar soaring, hitting exports.""Traditionally, the manufacturing sector has been the canary in the coal mine when it comes to slowing growth. To what extent does this bleed over into other sectors of the economy -- thats yet to be seen,"" Brett Ryan, a US economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York, told Bloomberg News.All three main indexes on Wall Street ended higher as investors bet that an expected increase in interest rates will be slow and gradual.In Asia, markets shifted in and out of positive territory. Shanghai was 0.1 percent lower after surging more than one percent at one point.- Eurozone boost -The benchmark index rose Monday and Tuesday, having plunged 5.5 percent at the end of last week on news that several top brokerages were being investigated as part of a crackdown after the summers market rout.However, the International Monetary Funds decision to include the yuan in its special drawing rights basket of elite currencies has provided some buying support.On currency markets talk of a slow rise in US rates weighed on the dollar, which retreated in New York to $1.0634 from $1.0566 and to 122.86 yen from 123.09 yen.The euro was also given support by data showing factory growth in the eurozone picked up the pace last month while unemployment tumbled, fuelling hopes the bloc is slowly recovering.The EUs Eurostat agency said unemployment in the 19-country region fell to 10.7 percent in October, the best reading since January 2012.

"World stock markets churned lower Friday on lingering disappointment over ""underwhelming"" eurozone stimulus measures and ahead of key US jobs data.Equities had plunged Thursday as the European Central Banks latest stimulus plan disappointed investors, sparking a global sell off that spilled over into Wall Street and Asia.In late Friday morning deals, London lost another 0.2 percent, Frankfurt fell 0.6 percent and Paris also slid 0.6 percent, one day after the key indices shed between two and four percent in value.Speculation had swirled for weeks that the ECB would ramp up its bond-buying programme and loosen monetary policy to bolster growth and counter weak inflation.Hopes were stoked Wednesday by news that eurozone inflation languished at 0.1 percent in November -- far lower than the ECBs official 2.0-percent target.The bank on Thursday cut deposit rates further into negative territory -- meaning lenders must pay to park cash with it and so look to loan more -- and extended the length of its bond purchases.- Huge let-down -However, the long-awaited announcement was seen as a huge let-down as it crucially failed to increase the size of the stimulus while the rate cut was less than hoped for.""Equity markets took a notable shake out yesterday in response to the underwhelming actions of the ECB,"" said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.""The central banks stimulus measures fell some way short of expectations, initiating degree of panic across the board.""This rattled US markets after the European close last night and is once again taking a toll in early trade as the weeks final session gets underway.""The news sent the euro surging on Thursday to a one-month peak at $1.0981, having earlier hit a 7.5-month low of $1.0524 in highly volatile deals.""Draghi failed to deliver on investors expectations,"" said ETX Capital analyst Daniel Sugarman.""In November the ECB governor had stated that the ECB would do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible -- which investors took to mean the unveiling of a significant surge in monetary stimulus in December.""The single currency had come under fierce selling pressure leading up to the announcement as dealers positioned themselves for more far-reaching measures.- Fed caution -The euros gains were also given support after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said the bank remained wary of a US interest rate rise because of concerns about a strong dollar and other central banks loose monetary policies.While the Fed is still widely expected to lift rates this month -- for the first time in nine years -- Yellens comments caused traders to baulk after a recent run-up in the dollar.

"A modest recovery in oil prices provided some respite for Asian energy firms Wednesday but stock markets extended losses as Chinas ongoing economic woes cast a pall over the regions trading floors.The cost of the black gold has plunged by almost a tenth since Fridays refusal by the OPEC oil exporters group to agree a ceiling on output despite oversupply and anaemic demand across the globe.The impact of the weak commodity price environment was also made stark Tuesday when US mining giant Anglo American said it would scythe almost two-thirds of its workforce and reduce investment by about $1 billion.On Wednesday US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up 1.7 percent in the morning while Brent added 1.2 percent.Among regional energy firms BHP Billiton added almost one percent in Sydney, Inpex gained 1.3 percent in Tokyo and Hong Kong-listed CNOOC put on 1.7 percent.However, the oil contracts are still struggling around seven-year lows and analysts said the gloom was likely to last for some time.""We remain of the view that oil will stay below $50 a barrel into the foreseeable future,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., told clients according to Bloomberg News.""The industrial metals and iron-ore thematics are basically facing the same factors that are influencing oil.""A global supply glut, weak demand and the growth slowdown in China have combined with soaring production to send crude slumping more than 60 percent over the past 18 months.Most Asian markets extended their losses of this week, tracking a downturn on Wall Street where all three main indexes ended in the red.Tokyo was 1.1 percent off by lunch, Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent and Sydney fell 0.3 percent while Taipei, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were also in negative territory.Shanghai was 0.2 percent down as ongoing worries about China overshadowed data showing November inflation was just above expectations.Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent last month, up from October and better than the forecast in a survey by Bloomberg News but well short of Beijings target rate of ""around three percent"".But the November reading remained well below Chinas annual target of an increase of ""around three percent"" announced in March.- Key figures around 0300 GMT -Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 1.1 percent at 19,281.46 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21803.28Euro/dollar: UP to $1.0912 from $1.0892 late TuesdayDollar/yen: DOWN to 122.78 yen from 122.97 yenNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.9 percent at 17,568.00 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.4 percent at 6,135.22 points (close)",business
"Oil prices edged up in Asia Thursday following signs of a slight improvement in US demand but concerns that an oversupply will persist past next year kept the commodity struggling at multi-year lows.Analysts said a sharp fall in the dollar on Wednesday may also have spurred some buying as weakness in the US currency makes dollar-priced oil cheaper.But analysts also noted that the unit will likely to gather strength before a Fed meeting next week in which the US central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up 23 cents at $37.39 and Brent crude for January was trading 33 cents higher at $40.44 at around 0300 GMT.Prices have slumped about nine percent since Fridays decision by the OPEC oil exporters club not to cut output despite pumping more than its target in the face of a global oversupply and weakness in the world economy.There was some good news when the Department of Energy said US Wednesday oil inventories fell 3.6 million barrels in the week ending December 4, a booster for prices as it indicates an uptick in demand.However, Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said: ""The market remains weak overall due to global oversupply, compounded by the OPECs decision to leave its production quota unchanged.""Investors will closely monitor the Federal Reserves policy-making meeting next week as dollar-dominated commodities will become more expensive if US dollar appreciates,"" he said.In a market commentary on Thursday, BMI Research said it expects prices to remain range-bound as the oil glut ""persists to 2018"".",business
"Global oil prices tanked on Friday close to seven-year lows on oversupply woes, sparking a fresh wave of selling on European and US stock markets as panicked investors fled the energy sector.Crude, which has slumped since OPEC left its oil output at a record high level last week, took another tumble after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oversupply would persist until late 2016.In response, Brent crude futures for January delivery collapsed to $38.90 per barrel -- a level last seen on December 31, 2008, during the global financial crisis.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in January dived to $36.12 -- last witnessed in February 2009.""Comments from the IEA have ... seen both WTI and Brent fall aggressively, after they (indicated) that the unrelenting supply would see oil prices lower into the new year,"" said analyst James Hughes at trading firm GKFX.Traders were also positioning themselves before the weekend and next Wednesdays expected interest rate hike, the first in nine years, from the US Federal Reserve.The prospect of higher rates boosts the greenback, which in turn makes dollar-priced crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies. That tends to weigh on oil demand and pull prices lower.""Oil prices have fallen heavily again this morning as the commodity rout continues to dominate the week,"" Hughes told AFP.""Prices have tumbled yet again as many investors try and position themselves ahead of the weekend, and also next weeks key Fed decision.""Oil has collapsed by more than 10 percent since the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided against cutting output despite plunging prices, weak global demand and the stubborn supply glut.That has sent shockwaves across world equity markets because low oil prices slash profits for energy majors like BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell.In mid-afternoon trading, major European markets saw early losses deepen with the London FTSE 100 index shedding 1.8 percent to drop below the 6,000 mark, while Frankfurt and Paris lost 2.2 percent in value.BPs share price slid 3.2 percent to 339.80 pence and Shells B shares dropped 4 percent to 1,498 pence and Anglo American shed 7 percent in a London session which saw just two FTSE 100 firms in positive territory.French giant Total saw its stock sink 3 percent.US stocks opened more than one percent lower, with investors selling down industrial heavyweights Dow Chemical and DuPont after they confirmed plans to merge.Ten minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.26 percent with the broad-based S&amp;P 500 and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index similarly heading south.Dow Chemical and DuPont both gave up about half the sharp gains that came Wednesday on leaked news of their mega-merger, losing 3.9 percent and 5.8 percent respectively.Most Asian markets also sank at the end of a painful week for global equities defined by a commodities rout which analysts expect to continue.With the global economy struggling, Chinas growth subdued and the dollar tipped to strengthen further, oil is expected to remain beaten down until possibly 2017.Shares in Hong Kong sank 1.1 percent -- a seventh-successive loss -- with CNOOC and PetroChina leading energy firms lower.On other markets Shanghai slipped 0.9 percent, but bargain-buying and a weaker yen helped Tokyo rally.- Key figures around 1500 GMT -London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.8 percent at 5,979 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 2.2 percent at 10,362Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 2.2 percent at 4,531EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 2.0 percent at 3,206New York - Dow Jones: DOWN 1.3 percent at 17,353.27Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 19,230.48 (close)Euro/dollar: UP to $1.1021 from $1.0939 late in New York on Thursday.Dollar/yen: UP to 121.70 yen from 121.62 yen",business

"International oil and gas companies and some leading global investors have shown interest in Pakistans promising gas sector, which is a very healthy sign, said Ghiyas Paracha, Chairman All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) in a statement here on Sunday.He said the oil and gas majors in US, Russia, China, UAE and Singapore have realised Pakistans interest in gas, prompting them to explore opportunities in gas import terminals and pipelines.Paracha said the confidence of investors is rising which will help the government bridge gas shortfall of two billion cubic feet.He said government is framing policy for gas import by CNG sector which will relieve government of the burden besides resulting in price cuts as compared to petrol.He said gas utilities are improving transmission and distribution system, which would increase their swap capacity by December 2016.He said completion of LNG pipeline and more terminals will settle the energy crisis, Ghiyas Paracha said.

"Energy-linked firms took another battering in Asia Monday morning, leading losses on regional markets as oil prices sank to fresh seven-year lows, with warnings of further falls to come for the commodity.However, while companies that rely on fossil fuels to drive profits were taking a hit, analysts said the weekend climate deal was unlikely to have had a major impact on their shares for now.Adding to the unease on trading floors is this weeks Federal Reserve policy meeting that is widely expected to see US interest rates lifted for the first time since 2006.Crude has slumped more than 12 percent since the OPEC oil producers group on December 4 opted against cutting its output levels, despite anaemic demand, a global economic malaise and a growth slowdown in major consumer China.And with the commodity falling further on Monday, regional energy companies tumbled.

"Oil prices were mixed in Asian trade on Tuesday after rebounding from sub-$35 levels in New York, but traders were braced for more downward pressure ahead of an expected hike in US interest rates.With global oversupply still dictating price trends, West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up two cents at $36.33 by 0330 GMT, while Brent crude for January dipped four cents to $37.88.WTI had fallen briefly in New York below $35 a barrel, the lowest levels since February 2009 during the global financial crisis.Ted Sloup of iiTrader.com called the rebound ""a healthy correction"" in a technically oversold market but added that the mood was ""still very bearish"" as investors continued to worry about global oversupply.BMI research said in a report that more downside pressure is expected in the coming months.""Oil prices will remain anchored by oversupply,"" it said, predicting that the global surplus ""will only narrow significantly post-2018.""Prices have fallen more than 60 percent from levels above $100 in June last year owing to slack global demand and a slowdown in key markets including China.Also, the world market is awash with the commodity as the OPEC exporters group refuses to cap production in a move to preserve its market share, while Iran is expected to restart pumping its own crude for shipment in 2016.An anticipated US interest rate hike on Wednesday could put further pressure on oil demand because the commodity is priced in dollars, making it more expensive for economies with weaker currencies.",business
"The dollar held steady on Wednesday after upbeat US inflation figures all but sealed the case for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, analysts said.Financial markets are focused on the US central banks last 2015 meeting, which wraps up Wednesday, with policymakers likely to give the go-ahead to a rate rise for the first time in almost a decade.The case for a rate lift-off -- which is a plus for the dollar -- has grown stronger over the past year as the worlds top economy appeared to be staging a firm recovery.That view got another boost Tuesday as fresh November data showed an inflation gauge that excludes volatile food and energy prices hit the Feds 2.0 percent target.""For (Fed Chair) Janet Yellen, who has been at pains to emphasise her concern of inflation overshooting if rates are not hiked in 2015, this final data point surely locks in the Fed rate rise now,"" Angus Nicholson, a market analyst with IG Ltd. in Melbourne, wrote in a commentary.The benchmark federal funds rate has been pegged near zero since December 2008 to support the economys recovery from deep recession.In Tokyo trading, the dollar rose to 121.87 yen from 121.66 yen Tuesday in New York, while it gained 0.18 percent against the Malaysian ringgit, and also ticked up against the Taiwanese dollar, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah and Singapore dollar.However, the South Korean won rose 0.67 percent on the greenback, as it bounced off recent drops.The euro edged up to $1.0936 and 133.18 yen from $1.0930 and 132.97 yen in US trading.The pound ticked up to $1.5050 from $1.5039 while the dollar edged down to 0.9901 Swiss Francs against 0.9914 francs in New York.While markets have been pricing in a rate hike, analysts said there was still room for the dollar to strengthen.""Money markets have not fully discounted a Fed rate hike, so there is scope for the US dollar to have a knee-jerk upside reaction,"" Elias Haddad, a currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg News.""We expect the (Federal Open Market Committee) to emphasise that its tightening cycle will be gradual.

"Crude prices extended losses in Asia Thursday after another report showing a further increase in US stockpiles added to fears about a global glut, while the dollar strengthened after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates.The under-pressure commodity suffered fresh selling on Wednesday after the US Department of Energy showed that supplies rose 4.8 million barrels in the week ending December 11.While they recovered slightly in early Asian trade, the two main contracts retreated by mid-morning.At around 0320 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January delivery was down six cents at $35.46 while Brent crude for February, a new contract, was down 15 cents at $37.24.Prices tumbled since December 4, when the OPEC oil exporters group refused to put a limit on the amount it produces, despite a supply glut, anaemic demand and a slowing global economy.""While the global oversupply has been persistent, expanding US supplies on warmer weather and low heating demand is putting a further downward pressure on oil,"" Kang Yoo Jin, a commodities analyst at NH Investment &amp; Securities, told Bloomberg News.""As the market generally expects another rate increase in March, oil prices will most likely stay low at least until the first quarter.""The Feds widely expected decision to lift interest rates for the first time since 2006 also weighed, with the dollar ticking up against most rivals, making oil more expensive to customers using weaker currencies.However, the banks boss Janet Yellen said she had been surprised by ""the further downward movement in oil prices"" and expected them to stabilise before edging up.Analysts said there was some support from US lawmakers decision to pass a bill Wednesday to lift a four-decade ban on oil exports as part of a massive government spending overhaul.Crude exports were banned in 1975 as prices skyrocketed in the wake of the Arab oil embargo.""A lifting of the export ban could narrow the spread between WTI and Brent, by providing the international market with a substitute for oil from current main supplying regions,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific Oil and Gas practice at professional services organization EY.",business

"Gold retained gains from a two-day rally on Tuesday, supported by a slide in the dollar, although a slump in oil prices and uncertainty over the pace of future U.S. interest rate hikes capped the metal's advance.While prices drew support from a big rise in assets of the top gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) late last week, a resumption in outflows this week indicated investors remained cautious.Spot gold was little changed at $1,079.20 an ounce by 0648 GMT, after gaining 2.5 percent in the last two sessions. The metal got a boost on Monday as the dollar fell after data from the Chicago Federal Reserve suggested the U.S. economy grew at a below average pace in November.""The jump in gold-ETF demand is impressive after the string of losses over the past couple of years, but the market will likely need to see further accumulation for the rally to be extended,"" said HSBC analyst James Steel.""A major stumbling block for a further gold rally is oil, and commodity prices in general,"" he said, adding that oil is a powerful drag on gold.Crude oil slid to its lowest levels since 2004 on Monday and more declines could ignite deflation fears.

But that was followed by outflows of three tonnes on Monday.Holdings of the fund had hit a seven-year low earlier in the month, as investors positioned themselves for higher interest rates in the United States.While persistent inflows into the fund can boost gold prices, a further slump in oil could undermine any rally.Also in focus was the pace of the Fed's future rate hikes. The Fed last week raised U.S. interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Investors fear higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold, while boosting the dollar.The Fed's promise of gradual rate hikes in coming months means the central bank will not raise rates at every meeting, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday. The more probable pace of upcoming hikes ""will be more like every other meeting,"" he said.",business

This was mainly followed by the US lifting its ban on crude oil exports,"" Singapore-based Phillip Futures said on Monday.The brokerage added that it expected ""a quiet week ahead"" with the biggest expected news for energy markets likely coming from U.S. inventory data to be published on Wednesday and Thursday.While the US slightly tightened, international markets remain over supplied as producers like Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) produce between half a million and 2 million barrels of crude every day in excess of demand.At the same time, developed and emerging economies especially in Asia are slowing.Japan's industrial output fell 1.0 percent in November from the previous month, government data showed on Monday, suggesting that sluggish emerging market demand continues to cloud the outlook for the economy.In Japan's refining sector, top oil refiner JX Nippon Oil &amp; Energy Corp said on Monday it would trim its domestic crude refining plans in January from a year earlier, due to unspecified problems with its refining operations and scheduled maintenance.The company, the core business unit of JX Holdings Inc, said it would process 1.11 million barrels per day (5.49 million kilolitres) of crude oil in January for domestic consumption, down 2 percent from a year earlier.Japan's domestic demand has been easing due to a shrinking population, while a decline in kerosene demand accelerated this month due to warmer temperatures, a spokesman said.In 2014, Japan was the third-largest global oil consumer, closely followed by India, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.",business

"Asian stocks were subdued on Tuesday, with Japanese and South Korean equities slipping, after crude oil prices resumed their slide and cooled investor sentiment.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were effectively unchanged, and looked set for a loss of around 12 percent for the year.Japan's Nikkei lost 0.3 percent and South Korea's KOSPI fell 0.4 percent. Australian stocks bucked the trend and rose 0.4 percent.On Monday, prices of both Brent and U.S. crude dropped more than 3 percent, reversing a brief rebound and dragging U.S. energy shares down 1.8 percent as the worst performing of the major S&amp;P sectors.Brent was at $36.60 a barrel, near an 11-year low of $35.98 struck last week.The Dow dipped 0.1 percent and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.2 percent overnight after trading resumed following the Christmas break, but activity is expected to remain thin until after the long New Year holiday weekend.In currencies, the dollar edged down 0.1 percent to 120.33 yen, within striking distance of a two-month low of 120.05 struck late last week.The greenback has been sapped by profit taking after the Federal Reserve this month hiked interest rates for the first time in nine years. The currency market will wait for the Fed to send fresh signals about when the second rate hike could take place in 2016 for potential dollar support.The euro nudged up 0.1 percent to $1.0977.The dollar fared better against its Canadian counterpart, which was weighed down as crude oil prices weakened again.The Canadian dollar stood little changed at C$1.3894 to the greenback after losing 0.7 percent overnight. The loonie fell to an 11-year low of C$1.4003 against the dollar earlier this month.""We are looking for USD/CAD to break 1.40 and head towards 1.45 in the first half of 2016.

"Crude oil futures fell around half a dollar early on Wednesday as the market remained under pressure from slowing demand and high supplies, while forecasts that a cold snap in Europe and the United States would be short-lived also hurt prices.Crude prices have plunged by two-thirds since mid-2014 as soaring output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and the United States led to a global surplus of between half a million and 2 million barrels per day.More recently, a slowing demand outlook, especially in Asia but also Europe, has started dragging on prices.Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading at $37.18 per barrel at 0140 GMT, down 69 cents or 1.82 percent from their last settlement. Brent futures were down 47 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $37.32 a barrel.Traders said the price falls were largely a result of a weak outlook for next year and the closing of 2015 trade books.""The 2016 outlook is for lower prices, especially early next year. Many are closing their last long positions for the year today as nobody wants to come back in January and be surprised badly. Better start with a clean sheet,"" a trader said.Forecasts that an upcoming cold weather in Europe will only be short-lived could also hurt crude prices.U.S. crude and Brent had both rallied about 3 percent in the previous session on hopes that a drop in temperatures would buoy demand for oil for heating purposes.But weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that average continental European temperatures are expected to drop from around 5 degrees Celsius currently towards and slightly below the seasonal norm of 2.4 degrees by Jan. 3 before rising to as high as 6-8 degrees by Jan. 7.For most of the United States, a brief cold period is also not expected to last for much more than a week.",business
"NEW YORK/Oil prices rose on Thursday but fell as much as 35 percent for the year after a race to pump by Middle East crude producers and U.S. shale oil drillers created an unprecedented global glut that may take through 2016 to clear.Global oil benchmark Brent and U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose between 1 and 2 percent on the day on short-covering and buying support in a thinly traded market ahead of the New Year holiday.But for 2015, both benchmarks fell double-digits for a second straight year as Saudi Arabia and other members of the once-powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) again failed to boost oil prices.The U.S. shale industry, meanwhile, surprised the world again with its ability to survive rock-bottom crude prices, churning out more supply than expected, even as the sell-off in oil slashed by two-thirds the number of drilling rigs in the country from a year ago.The United States also took a historic move in repealing a 40-year ban on U.S. crude exports to countries outside Canada, acknowledging the industry's growth.""You do have to tip your hat to the U.S. shale industry and their ongoing ability to drive down costs and hang in there, albeit by their fingernails,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, an energy hedge fund in New York.Brent crude settled up 82 cents at $37.28 a barrel, rebounding from a near 11-year low of $36.10 hit earlier in the session. For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Nio weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.""We have brimming oil inventories in Europe,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. ""And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.""Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that ""headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.""The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. ""The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks,"" it said.INDUSTRY PAINBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.",business

"Oil prices surged during the start of 2016 trading as relations between top crude producers Saudi Arabia and Iran deteriorated, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions, though weak Asian manufacturing data kept a lid on bullish expectations.Saudi Arabia, the worlds biggest oil exporter, cut diplomatic ties with Iran on Sunday in response to the storming of its embassy in Tehran.The diplomatic row between the two major oil producers escalated following Riyadhs execution of a prominent cleric on Saturday.Global oil benchmark Brent climbed more than a dollar to a high of $38.50 per barrel on Monday, before easing back to $38.10 at 0350 GMT, still up over 2 percent.US crudes West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 77 cents, or 2.08 percent, at $37.81 a barrel.Oil traders said the crisis between Saudi Arabia, also the worlds second-largest oil producer, and Iran, which holds some of the largest proven oil reserves, was pushing up prices.The clash between the two Middle Eastern rivals also comes as Iran hopes to ramp up oil exports following the expected removal of sanctions against it after reaching a deal over its alleged nuclear weapons development programme.""With increased geopolitical tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the market has put a premium on prices just when markets opened (in 2016),"" brokerage Phillip Futures said on Monday.Despite Mondays jump, oil prices are down by two-thirds since mid-2014 on ballooning oversupply as producers including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States pump between 0.5 million and 2 million barrels of oil every day in excess of demand.",business
"Asian share markets struggled to stabilize on Tuesday as Chinese stocks bounced from a shaky start, offering hope that Monday's plunge was a flash in the pan.The People's Bank of China injected a generous slug of liquidity into domestic markets to keep borrowing costs down.The central bank also set the value of its yuan currency a little firmer than many had expected, countering concerns China was seeking an aggressive devaluation to aid exports.After an opening skid, the CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen rebounded to be 0.7 percent higher. That followed a 7 percent dive on Monday and only added to the market's reputation for wild moves.Shares in Shanghai veered either side of flat and were last up 0.2 percent.""The price action reminds investors that the world is more connected than ever; volatility is likely here to stay, and liquidity may suffer if investor uncertainty worsens,"" analysts at Citi said in a note.""Global growth and geopolitical stability remain the main sources of concern.""Investors across the rest of Asia hoped for the best and nudged Japan's Nikkei up 0.4 percent, recouping just a little of Monday's 3.1 percent dive.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan swung higher to be up 0.3 percent, but Australia's market was still down by 0.9 percent.EMINI futures for the S&amp;P 500 ESc1 also hinted at a bounce with a rise of 0.25 percent.The Dow ended Monday down 1.58 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.53 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 2.08 percent as weak Chinese and U.S. factory activity surveys rekindled fears of a global economic slowdown.POLICY WATCHPolicymakers seemed to share the general sense of unease.A South Korean finance ministry official on Tuesday said the government will take action to stabilize markets if needed.Sweden on Monday gave its central bank chief formal powers to act immediately to weaken the crown and help push up inflation, a radical step among developed world institutions.Under Governor Stefan Ingves, Sweden's Riksbank has already slashed rates to a record low of -0.35 percent.The European Central Bank was under pressure to do yet more after German inflation proved surprisingly weak in December, pushing down bond yields and slugging the euro.The common currency was stuck at $1.0825 on Tuesday, having touched a one-month low around $1.0780. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar was flat at 98.872.The dollar regained some ground on the yen to stand at 119.49 after being as low as 118.68 on Monday.Oil prices edged up on Tuesday after a volatile session the previous day, with the impact of tension in the Middle East offset by worries over global economic growth.Brent LCOc1 for February delivery was quoted 29 cents firmer at $37.51 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 27 cents to $37.03.",business

"Oil prices slid more than 4 percent to new 11-year lows on Wednesday as the row between Saudi Arabia and Iran made any cooperation between major exporters to cut output even more unlikely.The furore over Saudi Arabias execution of a Shiite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.""There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.""Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising,"" Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that Chinas services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The Peoples Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the worlds largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United States, concerns over mounting oil stock levels persisted, with crude inventories likely to have risen by 439,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish its closely watched weekly data at 1530 GMT.Some analysts think oil prices have fallen too far and will stage a sharp recovery later in the year, with Commerzbank targeting $60 per barrel by the end of 2016.""This looks ambitious from current levels but current prices are unsustainably low,"" Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank, told the Global Oil Forum.""We are in a speculative exaggeration at the moment.""He added that he expects US oil production to fall at least 1 million bpd by autumn.",business
"Asian stocks were subdued early on Wednesday as floundering crude oil prices continued to dampen risk sentiment, while the dollar and yen drew support from anxiety over global growth and geopolitical risk stemming from Iran-Saudi tensions.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1 percent. Wall Street shares closed Tuesday on very modest gains and failed to provide Asia with much impetus.Australian shares lost 0.7 percent and South Korea's KOSPI dipped 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei bucked the trend and rose 0.2 percent.Risk markets are now waiting to see how Chinese equities will fare later in the session. Shanghai shares stabilised somewhat on Tuesday, following an arresting 7 percent plunge at the week's start that spooked stocks worldwide.Both the dollar and yen attracted bids amid the risk aversion that gripped financial markets globally from the start of 2016.The euro stood little changed at $1.0752 after shedding 0.8 percent overnight, when it a one-month low of $1.0711.The common currency was steady at 128.045 yen following an overnight drop of 1 percent. It dipped as far as 127.535 on Tuesday, its lowest since late April.Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, wrote that the U.S. and Japanese currencies were being bought because ""China is in trouble, U.S. data has been disappointing, Japan refuses to increase stimulus and oil prices continue to fall, but everyone's greatest fear is that stocks have finally peaked"".The yen had a slight edge over the greenback. The dollar traded at 119.14 after slipping 0.3 percent overnight. It had hit a 2-1/2-month low of 118.705 earlier this week.In commodities, crude oil prices struggled near 11-year lows, with the market giving more attention to the stronger dollar and swelling U.S. inventories rather than growing tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.Relations between the two major oil producers collapsed in acrimony this week after Saudi Arabia executed a cleric, setting off a storm of protests in Tehran.U.S. crude nudged up to $36.28 a barrel but was still down 2 percent on the week and near a seven-year low of $33.98 hit late last month.Oil-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar sank deeper on shaky crude prices.

"The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shiite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the worlds biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016. The world is now producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it is consuming, and Iran is promising to add another million bpd to supply over the next 12 months.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree any caps on production at its annual meeting in Vienna last month, amid acrimony between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Gulf regions main Sunni and Shiite powers.If there was still any suggestion that the two rivals might somehow overcome their animosity to agree to manage supply this year, it was buried on Monday when Riyadh called off diplomatic ties with Tehran over Irans response to the execution of Saudi<br/>Shiite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.Several OPEC delegates told Reuters they now saw no chance of any improvement in relations between OPEC members, which have been already very low over the past months.<br/><br/>""This new situation will just make it worse and I see no agreement to be reached within OPEC,"" one representative to OPEC from a member country outside the Gulf region said, on condition of anonymity.",business
"The World Bank on Wednesday cut its global economic growth forecast for 2016, saying the weak performance of major emerging market economies will tamp activity overall, as will anaemic showings from developed countries such as the United States.Global growth should accelerate to 2.9 percent this year from 2.4 percent in 2015, the bank said, but that still represents a downgrade from its June forecast for 3.3 percent growth.The bank raised particular concern about the flagging performance of top emerging economies.""Given the size and global economic integration of the largest emerging markets - Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China, and South Africa, or the so-called BRICS - the simultaneous slowdown underway in all but one of them could have significant spillovers to the rest of the world,"" the report said.The bank forecast the Russian and Brazilian economies would continue to contract in 2016 rather than return to growth as it had estimated in its previous outlook in June.Real gross domestic product in Russia could shrink at a 0.7 percent annual pace this year, it said. In June it had forecast 0.7 percent GDP growth for 2016. The bank estimates the Russian economy shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.In Brazil, GDP is forecast to decline by 2.5 percent in 2016 compared with an earlier estimate for growth of 1.1 percent, the World Bank said. The Brazilian economy likely contracted at a 3.7 percent rate in 2015.China GDP growth was estimated to slow to 6.7 percent in 2016 from an estimated 6.9 percent in 2015. In June the bank had estimated 2016 growth of 7.0 percent.The South African economy should grow at a modestly faster rate in 2016 than last year - 1.4 percent compared with 1.3 percent - but substantially slower than the 2.1 percent growth forecast in June.Of that group, India was the only one expected to see notable improvement in economic performance from 2015 - advancing at a 7.8 percent rate in 2016 versus 7.3 percent in 2015. But even there, the bank nipped its 2016 estimate by 0.1 percentage point from its earlier forecast.The bank also trimmed its outlook for the United States and other developed economies.The U.S. economy should grow by 2.7 percent, down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent but up from 2015's 2.5 percent.Estimates for growth in the euro zone were trimmed by the same amount, to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent previously, although that would mark a modest acceleration from 2015's estimated 1.5 percent rate.",business
"Brent crude prices fell to fresh 11-year lows on Thursday as fresh concerns over China's economy added to huge storage overhangs, near-record production and slowing demand that have already pummelled prices.China accelerated the devaluation of the yuan on Thursday, sending currencies across the region reeling and domestic stock markets tumbling, as investors feared the Asian giant was kicking off a virtual trade war against its competitors. Trading on its stock markets was suspended for the rest of the day.Global oil prices have crashed 70 percent since mid-2014 as near record output from major producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and North America create a ballooning overhang that has left storage tanks around the world struggling to cope with the excess oil.At the same time, demand is slowing, especially in Asia where the biggest economy and energy consumer, China, is seeing the slowest economic growth in a generation.Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell to new 11-year lows of $33.09 per barrel on Thursday, undercutting a low from a day earlier, although prices edged back to $33.52 per barrel by 0213 GMT.Traders said a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which might normally be seen as posing a risk to oil supplies, may actually be bearish as it all but eliminates cooperation over production between the two OPEC members.""Neither one of them (Saudi Arabia or Iran) is going to voluntarily cede a single barrel to the other, so it arguably makes a coordinated production cut even less likely than it has been,"" one Middle East oil trader said.In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures set fresh 2009 lows of $32.77 per barrel, with prices crawling back to $33.25 by 0213 GMT.Analysts said that the huge U.S. storage overhang was the main reason for falling WTI crude.""Data suggest gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles increased 10.6 million barrels and 6.3 million barrels, respectively, last week. The rise in gasoline and distillate inventory more than offset the fall in crude oil inventory levels by 5.09 million barrels to (still near record) 482.3 million barrels last week,"" ANZ bank said.The huge storage overhang means that even if U.S. production falls this year as drillers succumb to low prices, it will take many months to work down excess supplies.With the global economy looking shaky due to China's slowdown, traders said the outlook for oil remains for cheap prices for much of this year.",business

"Global benchmark oil futures rallied more than 2 percent on Friday, following Asian shares higher after Beijing deactivated a circuit breaker mechanism that was blamed for aggravating equity market crashes.Chinese stocks were also boosted as the yuan currency firmed in early trade after the central bank strengthened its official rate for the first time in nine trading days.Brent had risen 56 cents to $34.31 a barrel as of 0150 GMT, having hit an intraday high of $34.72. It settled down 48 cents at $33.75 in the previous session, after marking $32.16, a level last seen in April 2004.U.S. crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading 63 cents higher at $33.90 a barrel after settling at $33.27 on Thursday. In the last session, it hit its lowest since late 2003 at $32.10.OPEC's smallest member Ecuador, which has increased debt and reduced investments due to the oil price plunge, said on Thursday it would continue to press for production cuts at the cartel's next meeting scheduled for June.""Oil remains under pressure amid concerns about China's economy,"" ANZ said in a note on Friday.""With rising Middle East tensions now a distant memory, oil is likely to test the $30 a barrel level amid growing concerns on the impact of a weakening yuan on Chinese demand.""Natixis said in a research note that global demand should increase by 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) as opposed to 1.7 million bpd in 2015.""There are several clouds on the horizon which may impact demand growth such as the potential slowdown in China and any other emerging markets,"" it said.Chart-watching oil analysts said if oil prices do not rally hard on Friday, they seem doomed to drop below $30 a barrel for the first time since 2003.",business
"The benchmark S&amp;P 500 U.S. stock index on Friday notched its worst five-day start to a year on record as fear of a slowdown in China offset a surprisingly strong payrolls report in the United States.Brent and U.S. crude futures prices extended their weekly slide to more than 10 percent, pressured by unrelenting oversupply and a bleak demand outlook.Stocks had opened higher on Wall Street after data showed the economy created many more jobs than expected in December and previous months were revised higher.But the S&amp;P 500 hit its session high within five minutes of the open and closed near its session low, down more than 1 percent on the day and 6 percent for the week.It was the largest weekly drop in more than four years and the largest 5-day slide to start a year on record.""The markets reaction (to the jobs report) is something between curious and concerning,"" said Richard Scalone, co-head of foreign exchange at TJM Brokerage in Chicago.""People are skittish in holding positions. If you are long stocks, you think you might be saved by this jobs report. If they don't go up, you are in trouble.Investors fear that China, the second-largest economy in the world, is growing more slowly than expected and could further weigh on commodity prices and global economic growth.Stocks and other risk assets got support earlier from Asian markets after China nudged the yuan higher for the first time in nine days, easing fears it had lost control of the currency, and as the Chinese stock benchmark rose 2 percent.Europe initially followed suit, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed down 1.5 percent and lost 6.7 percent this week.MSCI's broadest gauge of stocks globally was down 0.8 percent on the day and fell more than 6 percent this week, also the largest such drop in more than four years.""What's going to come out of China is a short-term concern for the market, so maybe the ... decline we've seen is not quite enough,"" said Andrew Slimmon, a Chicago-based portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which manages more than $400 billion in assets.He said concerns are only near-term and the beginning of earnings season will ""remind investors that the U.S. micro story hasn't changed.""Traders are indeed more concerned near-term, with the spot price of the CBOE volatility index higher than futures three months down the line. The VIX ""fear index"" closed Friday at its highest since late September.For others, however, the mood is bleaker.""The start of the year is very poor, so that's got investors on the defensive,"" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.""In the face of weakening global growth,"" he said, ""it's difficult to find reasons to commit money at this point even if one is bullish.""NO RESPITE FOR OILBrent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures seesawed through the day, settling lower after Wall Street stock prices gave up earlier strength. The two benchmarks hit 12-year lows earlier in the week.Goldman Sachs said in a note on Friday the market needs to see sustained low prices through the first quarter and that producers were not ready to slash output at current prices.Brent crude rose as much as 2.9 percent but was last down 1.2 percent on the day at $33.33 per barrel. WTI fell 1 percent to $32.95 a barrel after gaining more than 3 percent earlier.The benchmark U.S. Treasury yield hit the lowest since late October, reversing an initial rise after the strong jobs data that also showed hourly earnings were unchanged versus expectations of a 0.2 percent increase. Continued safety bids also kept yields from climbing.U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were up 10/32 in price to yield 2.1173 percent, from 2.153 percent late Thursday.The dollar climbed on measures taken by China to ease this weeks market turmoil and on the U.S. payrolls data, but gains were limited by worries over whether Beijing has done enough to calm its battered stock market.The euro was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at $1.0923, while the greenback lost 0.1 percent to 117.52 yen.Spot gold fell for the first time this week but gained more than 4 percent for the week, the most for any week since August.",business

"Gold edged higher on Monday, trading close to last session's nine-week high as pressure on Asian stock markets supported safe-haven bids for the metal.Asian share markets swept lower after Wall Street suffered its worst starting week in history and doubts over Beijing's economic competence sent investors into the arms of the safe-haven yen and sovereign bonds.Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,105 an ounce by 0330 GMT. U.S. gold gained 0.7 percent to $1,105.2.""We have some supportive factors in the market such as Saudi Arabia-Iran tensions, devaluation of yuan which have prompted safe have appeal of gold,"" said Ronald Leung, chief dealer at Lee Cheong Gold Dealers Ltd in Hong Kong.Gold climbed to its highest since early November on Friday, adding more than 4 percent to its value this year, on concerns over the Chinese economy and tumbling stock markets.Perceived missteps by China's authorities in controlling their share market and currency have led to concerns Beijing might lose its grip on economic policy too.China will face great difficulty in achieving economic growth above 6.5 percent over the 2016-2020 period due to slowing global demand and rising labour costs at home, the China Securities Journal quoted a top state adviser as saying.Investment appetite for bullion showed signs of picking up last week. Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, rose 4.2 tonnes on Thursday, data from the fund showed.Bullion is often seen as an alternative investment during times of financial uncertainty, although safe-haven rallies tend to be short-lived.Gold slid 10 percent last year on fears higher U.S. rates would lower demand for the non-interest-paying asset, while boosting the dollar.

"US crude prices continued a relentless dive early on Tuesday approaching a 20 percent drop since the beginning of the year as analysts scrambled to cut their 2016 oil price forecasts and traders bet on further price falls.US crude West Texas Intermediate (WTI) CLc1 were trading at $31.34 per barrel at 0805 GMT on Tuesday, down 7 cents from their last settlement and almost 19 percent lower than at the beginning of the year. WTI has shed over 70 percent in value since the downturn began in mid-2014.Trading data showed that managed short positions in WTI crude contracts, which would profit from a further fall in prices, are at a record high, implying that many traders expect further falls.Analysts also adjusted to the early price rout in the year, with Barclays, Macquarie, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered and Societe Generale all cut their 2016 oil price forecasts on Monday.""A marked deterioration in oil market fundamentals in early 2016 has persuaded us to make some large downward adjustments to our oil price forecasts for 2016,"" Barclays bank said.""We now expect Brent and WTI to both average $37/barrel in 2016, down from our previous forecasts of $60 and $56, respectively,"" it added.But it was Standard Chartered that took the most bearish view, stating that prices could drop as low as $10 a barrel.""Given that no fundamental relationship is currently driving the oil market towards any equilibrium, prices are being moved almost entirely by financial flows caused by fluctuations in other asset prices, including the USD and equity markets,"" the bank said.""We think prices could fall as low as $10/bbl before most of the money managers in the market conceded that matters had gone too far,"" it added.",business
"Asian shares made their first real rally of the year on Wednesday after Chinese trade data beat expectations, offering a rare shaft of light for the global economy.Japan's Nikkei jumped 2.6 percent from a near-one-year trough, while battered Australian stocks gained 1.3 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan sped ahead by 1.6 percent and away from its lowest since late 2011.Even China's mercurial markets found some relief with the Shanghai Composite Index up 0.8 percent and the CSI300 index 0.9 percent.The good cheer spread to E-mini futures contracts for the S&amp;P 500 which climbed 0.8 percent.The gains came after China reported its exports had risen 2.3 percent in yuan-denominated terms in December, from a year earlier while imports dipped 4.0 percent.In U.S. dollar terms, China's December exports exceeded analyst expectations, falling 1.4 pct from a year earlier, while imports fell by 7.6 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall 8.0 percent and imports to fall 11.5 percent.While investors harbour suspicions about the reliability of the data, on the surface they offered hope that world trade flows were at least stabilising after a dismal 2015.It also suggested Beijing might prove successful in its increasingly forceful attempts to stabilise the yuan, so dampening fears of a sustained devaluation.All of which galvanised currency markets where the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, was up half a U.S. cent at $0.7036.With safe-haven suddenly out of favour, the Japanese yen and the euro eased broadly. The U.S. dollar moved up to 118.22 yen from an early 117.61, while the euro slipped to $1.0815 from $1.0860.Against a basket of currencies the dollar gained 0.2 percent.Likewise, low-risk sovereign debt had to surrender a little of their recent gains and yields on 10-year paper nudged up 3 basis points 2.137 percent.The hint of firmer demand from China provided a reprieve for commodity prices, which have been under the hammer for months.U.S. crude edged up 44 cents to $30.88 a barrel a day after diving as deep as $29.93 to break the $20 barrier for the first time in 12 years.Benchmark Brent was quoted 31 cents higher at $31.17 a barrel.

"Oil prices hit their lowest since 2003 on Monday, as the market braced for a jump in Iranian exports after the lifting of sanctions against the country at the weekend.The UN nuclear watchdog on Saturday said Tehran had met its commitments to curtail its nuclear programme, and the United States immediately revoked sanctions that had slashed the OPEC member's oil exports by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak to little more than 1 million bpd.""Iran is now free to sell as much oil as it wants to whomever it likes at whatever price it can get,"" said Richard Nephew, program director for Economic Statecraft, Sanctions and Energy Markets at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Iran is ready to increase its crude exports by 500,000 bpd, its deputy oil minister said on Sunday.In what traders described as a knee-jerk reaction, international Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003, before recovering to $28.56 by 0208 GMT, still down over 1 percent from its settlement on Friday.US crude was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, after hitting a 2003-low of $28.36 earlier in the session.""The lifting of sanctions on Iran should see further downward pressure on oil ... in the short term,"" ANZ said on Monday.""Iran's likely strategy in offering discounts to entice customers could see further downward pressure on prices in the near term,"" the bank added.Trading data shows that short positions in US crude markets, which would profit from further price falls, have hit a fresh record despite steep recent drops.While this could trigger sudden price jumps once traders close positions to cash in from further drops, it also indicates that many market participants think there is still more downside to prices.Iran's potential new exports come at a time when global markets are already reeling from chronic oversupply as producers pump a million barrels or more of crude every day in excess of demand, pulling down crude prices by over 75 percent since mid-2014 and by over a quarter since the start of 2016.And although analysts expect Iran to take some time before being able to fully revive its export infrastructure, suffering from years of underinvestment during the sanctions, it does have at least a dozen Very Large Crude Carrier super-tankers filled and in place to sell into the market.The oil price rout is also hurting stock markets, with Asian shares set to slide to near their 2011 troughs on Monday, stoking further worries about a global economic downturn.""Growth keeps slowing ... Lower commodity prices, including oil, partly reflect weakening demand itself. In addition, the downturn in mining capex and the declining income of commodity producers is weighing on exports from Asia,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian Economics Research at HSBC, Hong Kong.",business

The greenback added about 0.4 percent to 117.38 yen after falling as low as 115.97 on Wednesday, even as it marked impressive gains against some emerging market currencies.""It is not your ordinary day in the foreign exchange market when the Russian rouble and the Mexican peso hit record lows while the Hong Kong dollar falls to its weakest level since 1999,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.""Emerging market countries bear the brunt of the selling because the slowdown in global growth and volatility in commodities causes significant economic damage for these countries,"" she said in a note to clients.U.S. data out on Wednesday undermined the dollar overnight. U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December, suggesting inflation was more sluggish than the U.S. Federal Reserve believed.Other Wednesday data showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month, which led investors to pare expectations of further interest rate hikes this year.The euro edged down about 0.2 percent to $1.0870, ahead of the European Central Bank's regular policy meeting later in the session. Expectations are for the ECB to hold interest rates steady but highlight increasing risks to growth and inflation while keeping the door open for further easing steps later this year.",business
"Oil prices rose for a second session on Friday, moving further away from 12-year lows plumbed earlier this week, as cold US and European weather as well as firmer financial markets gave some traders reason to cash in on record short positions.While benchmark crude futures on both sides of the Atlantic were poised for their first weekly gain this year, analysts cautioned the price rally was unsustainable given soaring inventories amid persistent overproduction.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 17 cents at $29.70 per barrel at 0206 GMT, around $3.50 away from a 12-year low of $26.19 hit earlier this week. Prices were headed for a 1 percent weekly rise.WTI prices could test a resistance at $30.85 based on a Fibonacci retracement measured from the downtrend between Jan. 4-20, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.International benchmark Brent was up 24 cents at $29.49 per barrel, off a 12-year low of $27.10 and set for a 2 percent gain for the week.Oil prices drew support from freezing weather conditions and snowstorms that have gripped the US East Coast and parts of continental Europe like Germany, lifting demand for heating oil. However, meteorological data in Reuters shows that the current cold snaps will likely to be short-lived.The cold weather in North America and Europe follows an extremely mild start to the winter in large parts of the northern hemisphere that had led to weaker-than-usual demand for oil, exacerbating a plunge in prices earlier this year.Traders said that a lot of people with open short positions in the market, which profit from falling prices, had decided to cash in when prices plunged 30 percent between the beginning of the year and the middle of this week. They have now flipped into buying at low costs, lifting oil futures.""More stable global markets are likely to see speculative buying re-emerge in commodities that have suffered heavy losses in recent weeks. However, these rallies are likely to remain short-lived,"" ANZ bank said.Analysts said the fundamental reason for low oil prices remained unchanged, with producers around the world pumping over 1 million barrels of crude every day beyond demand, leaving storage tanks brimming.US crude inventories rose 4 million barrels in the last week, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""At 486.5 million barrels, US crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years,"" the EIA said.",business
"Crude oil futures extended gains on Monday following a surge at the end of last week on short-covering and fuel demand triggered by freezing weather in parts of the northern hemisphere.Oil prices soared 10 percent on Friday, one of the biggest daily rallies ever, as bearish traders who had taken out record short positions scrambled to close them, betting the market's long rout may finally be over.Brent had gained 8 cents to $32.26 a barrel by 0221 GMT after touching $32.69 a barrel earlier in the day. It settled at $32.18 a barrel in the previous session.U.S. crude rose 5 cents to $32.24 a barrel, compared with its session-high of $32.64 and previous settlement at $32.19.""A change in investor sentiment was the key factor, with speculative short positions in WTI falling from historically high levels the previous week,"" ANZ said in a note on Monday, referring to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude.""Low crude oil prices continue to negatively impact high cost U.S. oil producers. Indeed, recent Baker Hughes data suggested U.S. oil explorers idled more oil rigs this week.""Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao said on Monday that Brent oil faces resistance at $32.72 per barrel, and may hover below this level for one day or retrace to support at $30.98, before rising again.A massive snowstorm on the U.S. East Coast helped stoke demand for oil for heating, helping push up crude prices. While New York and Philadelphia were getting back to business, Washington was not ready after an historic storm dumped more than 20 inches (51 cm) of snow on the city and nearly three feet (1 metre) in surrounding areas.Asian stocks gained early on Monday, relieved after seeing Wall Street rally on the back of a sharp rise in crude oil prices. The dollar was steady at 118.75 yen after surging 0.9 percent on Friday, when it touched a two-week peak of 118.88.",business
"Asian stocks moved further away on Monday from four-year lows struck last week, as the blizzard on the US East coast pushed oil prices higher, relieving some of the bearish pressure on Wall Street and world markets.Global equities also took heart from the European Central Bank signalling last week additional monetary easing steps to come, raising hopes that other central banks, like the Bank of Japan, would take the same path.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2 percent, putting further distance between a four-year low plumbed last week.Shanghai stocks added 0.9 percent, Tokyo's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent and Australian shares advanced more than 1 percent to a 10-day peak.""The latest rebound in oil, combined with European and Japan central bank's hinting at further stimulus, has provided a short-term reprieve for what so far this year, can be described as a nervous and punishing market,"" said Gary Huxtable, client adviser at Atlantic Pacific Securities.On Friday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 2 percent and the Dow added 1.3 percent Friday as a cold snap in North America and Europe caused a rally in oil prices. The S&amp;P energy sector surged 4.3 percent.Both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan hold policy meetings this week, with the Fed meeting on Jan. 26-27 and the BOJ meeting immediately after, on Jan. 28-29.Investors will look for any hints of when the Fed intends to make a second interest rate hike, while there is speculation that the BOJ could opt to take additional easing measures.""We expect no action from the Fed or BOJ, although investors will be looking for a more dovish forward bias as the renewed decline in oil prices lowers inflation expectations globally,"" wrote strategists at Barclays.Risk aversion amid fears of a China-led global slowdown and oil prices sinking to 13-year lows had rocked global markets at the start of the year, and the lull in flight-to-quality seen towards the end of last week weighed on safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR nudged up to 2.05 percent after rising to as high as 2.089 percent on Friday, the highest in a week.The dollar was steady at 118.795 yen after surging 0.9 percent on Friday, when it touched a two-week high of 118.88. The euro was little changed at $1.0801 after losing 0.8 percent on Friday.The Australian dollar, sensitive to the ebb and flow in risk appetite and fluctuations in commodity prices, traded at $0.7002 after touching a nine-day high of $0.7046 on Friday.Crude, recently under pressure from a global glut, jumped percent as harsh winter weather on the U.S. East coast boosted demand for heating oil. U.S. crude climbed 9 percent and Brent LCOc1 bounced 10 percent on Friday.U.S. crude was last up 0.3 percent at $32.29 a barrel.

"MANILA: Gold climbed to a two-week high on Tuesday as falling equities burnished bullions safe-haven draw, and the dollar also came under pressure as the Federal Reserve meets against a backdrop of a slowing global economy.Risk appetite soured again as equities and crude oil resumed their decline, boosting gold demand.Spot gold touched a session peak of $1,111.26 an ounce, its loftiest since Jan. 8, and was up 0.3 percent at $1,110.86 by 0313 GMT.""Gold might go for a run,"" said Brian Lan, managing director at gold dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore, adding the metal can test $1,138, a level last reached in November.""If that is breached, it could go to $1,160.""U.S. gold for February delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,111.50 an ounce.Indications that a wobbly global economy may limit the opportunity for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year also supported gold.The Federal Open Market Committee starts a two-day policy meeting later on Tuesday, and is widely expected to leave its federal funds rate unchanged at 0.25-0.50 percent.The probability of another rate increase at the next Fed meeting in March has eased, with some analysts seeing it postponed to later in the year.That puts downward pressure on the dollar and benefits gold, which has gained nearly 5 percent so far this year after declining in 2015 for a third year in a row.At this weeks meeting, it is likely that ""the Fed will reiterate its dovish stance and this should push gold prices up"", INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir wrote to clients.Meir said the poor shape of the U.S. equity market shows ""a major capitulation will be needed in order to clear out much of the selling"", suggesting investors should keep a bullish gold bias in the near term.Spot platinum was down 0.3 percent at $855.74 an ounce, but well off last weeks seven-year trough of $806.31.Platinum is forecast to average less than $1,000 an ounce in 2016 for the first time in more than a decade as global growth concerns and demand fallout from the Volkswagen scandal grip the market, a Reuters poll showed.Spot palladium slipped 0.3 percent to $488.50 an ounce and silver gained 0.2 percent to $14.27.",business
"Asian shares pushed back into the black on Thursday as investors dipped their toes back into equities and demand for safe haven assets such as the yen and sovereign bonds faded.A bounce in oil prices offered some salve to strained nerves. While Brent crude was off 23 cents at $32.87 a barrel, this followed a 4 percent jump on Wednesday after Russia hinted at co-operation with OPEC on oversupply.U.S. crude eased back 21 cents to $32.09.After starting weaker, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan swung 0.4 percent firmer in very choppy trade.Likewise, Japan's Nikkei turned 0.3 percent higher having been down more than 1 percent at one stage. Shanghai's Composite Index was just a whisker lower.The initial losses followed a poor finish on Wall Street, though dealers noted E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 had since rebounded by 0.65 percent.The Dow had ended Wednesday with losses of 1.38 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.09 percent and the Nasdaq shed 2.18 percent.Apple's shares fell 6.57 percent after the iPhone maker reported its slowest-ever rise in shipments, while Boeing lost 8.9 percent in its biggest fall since August 2011.The blame for Wall Street's fall was laid at the door of the Federal Reserve, with investors apparently frustrated the central bank was not concerned enough about the global outlook to scale back its plans for policy tightening.Rather, the Fed left all options open, including a hike at the next meeting in March.""We have no doubt that the market was looking for a 'Fed put' via some commentary about the committee growing increasingly nervous about financial markets and the global backdrop,"" wrote Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBCCM.""Instead, the Fed chose the pragmatic route.""The reaction to the Fed in currency markets was much more muted. The dollar gained on the safe-haven yen to 118.88, while the euro was sidelined at $1.0883.Against a basket of currencies, the dollar edged up 0.12 percent.The New Zealand dollar fell more than half a U.S. cent after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said low inflation meant further policy easing may now be required, having previously flagged that it would not cut rates further.The kiwi dollar fell to $0.6428, from around $0.6480.There is little in the way of market-moving economic data out of Asia. In Europe, Britain's fourth-quarter growth data looms large for the embattled pound.Annual economic growth is expected to have slowed to 1.9 percent, from 2.1 percent, an outcome that could push expectations for a hike in interest rates even further out.

Pakistan should do the same, he added.Due to good policies of the government, Pakistan has survived from being bankrupt, he remarked.Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar in his welcome remarks said due to prudent reform initiatives of the government the tax to GDP ratio had risen from 8.5 percent to 10 percent while the revenues had registered 18.2 percent growth.We are on the track and economic indicators are showing improvement, he added.Ishaq Dar further said that GDP growth in fiscal year was 4.24 percent which was the highest in seven years and it would be further increased to 5 percent in current financial year.Fiscal deficit he said would be brought down to 4.3percent in the current fiscal year.He also informed that for Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) allocations had been increased three times.Dar said previous governments did not give proper attention on energy generation which created energy crisis in the country.He added the government had initiated a number of energy projects and by 2018 10 000 MW more electricity would be added in the system.Ahsan Iqbal on the occasion highlighted the governments vision 2025 initiated for the benefit of the country and its people.He said that China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) had been initiated at a cost of US 46 billion which would be a game change not only for Pakistan but the entire region.",business
"Pakistan has officially kicked off its Kinnow export two months ahead; the government has set an export target of 400,000 tonnes for 2015-16 which is 100,000 tonnes higher than the export target for the previous season.However, growers and exporters warn this year that Kinnow production is sub-par and that there is a very likely possibility that the target will be missed by a long shot.Former FPCCI Chairman Standing Committee Ahmad Jawad said the low export quality yield in the ongoing season would keep Pakistan away from the opportunity to fill the gap created by the Russian ban on the import of Turkish oranges after the recent events in the Middle East.He said if government doesnt use preventive measures then Kinnow export will be squeezed further in next two to three years.",business

"The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.The agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.",business

(1130 GMT).The sanctions, imposed over Irans nuclear programme, were lifted last month after an agreement with world powers, allowing Tehran to resume selling oil freely in international markets.Iran exported around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude before 2012, but sanctions cut that to around 1.1 million bpd.Tehran has pledged to raise supply by around 1 million bpd in the next 6-12 months.",business
"Crude oil futures rebounded on Wednesday on investor hopes that a deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia to freeze oil output at January levels would lead to a wider pact among producers that could eventually see production cuts to support prices.Brent crude had climbed 34 cents to $32.52 a barrel by 0455 GMT, after settling down $1.21 in the previous session.It had surged to $35.55 a barrel in early trade on Tuesday.US crude was up 19 cents at $29.23 a barrel, having ended the last session down 40 cents.Top oil producers Russia and Saudi Arabia on Tuesday agreed to limit oil production at January levels, provided other oil exporters joined in, but stopped short of agreeing cuts in oil output.Iraq, Qatar and Venezuela said they would freeze output at January levels provided a deal could be agreed, while OPEC member Iran could be offered special terms to freeze oil production levels, sources said.Oil prices initially surged on Tuesday on news of the deal but early gains were wiped out by the realisation that there would be no immediate supply cuts to tackle global oversupply.""It was a buy the rumour, sell the fact event,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydneys OptionsXpress.""The market is coming around to the idea that it is not bad news, but not as good news as it was anticipating,"" he said, adding that investors were hoping for production cuts.Moves to freeze output at January levels will make little difference to the overall supply-demand balance this year and wont be enough to clear the 600,000 barrels per day surplus projected for the year, analysts FGE said in a note on Wednesday.""It could pave the wave for further action to be taken should the likes of Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia deem it necessary,"" FGE said.April crude futures will remain range-bound, Singapores Phillip Futures said in a note on Wednesday.Saudi Arabias oil production has stagnated at slightly more than 10 million bpd throughout 2015, meaning that ""all that was achieved was an agreement to continue what they were doing"", Phillip Futures said.Investors are also eyeing US oil inventory data later on Wednesday for further direction on oil prices.US crude stocks rose by 3.9 million barrels to 505.9 million barrels in the week to Feb. 12, according to a Reuters poll of analysts on Tuesday.Weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energys Energy Information Administration (EIA) will be released on Wednesday and Thursday respectively, a day later than usual because of a public holiday on Monday.",business
"NEW YORK/Oil prices rose 7 percent on Wednesday after Iran voiced support for a Russia-Saudi-led move to freeze production to deal with the market glut that had pressured crude prices to their lowest in a dozen years.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh met counterparts from Venezuela, Iraq and Qatar in Tehran for over two hours on Wednesday, saying the proposed production ""ceiling"" should be the first step toward stabilizing the market.Zanganeh, quoted by Tehran's Shana news agency, did not say explicitly say that Iran will keep its own output at January's levels, in line with the proposal that major producers including Russia and Saudi Arabia restrict output.An Iranian official, speaking before Wednesday's meeting, said Iran would continue increasing its oil output to levels held before the 2012 trade sanctions imposed on the fourth largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Tehran has been the main obstacle to the first joint OPEC and non-OPEC deal in 15 years, after its pledge to recapture market share lost to sanctions.Even so, Zanganeh's endorsement of the production freeze plan helped spark a powerful rally.Brent settled up $2.32, or 7.2 percent, at $34.50 a barrel.U.S. crude closed up $1.62, or 5.6 percent, at $30.66 a barrel.Prices extended gains in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed a stockpile drop of 3.3 million barrels versus analysts' forecasts for a build of 3.9 million barrels. The U.S. government will release official stockpile data on Thursday.Options expiry in U.S. crude also fed Wednesday's rebound, some traders said.Some investors said they had a better outlook for oil now.""I'm pricing between $35 and $45 for Brent by summer, as we still have a daily surplus of up to 1.7 million barrels of oil to contend with,"" said Phil Davis, an independent crude trader at PSW Investments.Others were more skeptical. ""I think people will be in a wait-and-see mode,"" said Scott Shelton, energy broker for ICAP. ""Risk would be lower because of the volatility involved.""Traded volume in U.S. crude futures was just above 500 million barrels, lower than the past three sessions, Reuters data showed, despite the price gains and activity prior to options expiry.",business

"Asian share markets edged cautiously higher on Monday as investors awaited a rush of February industry surveys to take the pulse of the global economy, while sterling suffered on concerns the UK might yet vote to leave the European Union.A busy week for data culminates with a Group of 20 meeting that offers leaders a chance to soothe market concerns with talk of coordination, even if it produces nothing concrete.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.7 percent, having rebounded more than 4 percent last week.E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 ESc1 were also up 0.3 percent.The calmer mood was aided by oil as Brent crude added 31 cents to $33.32 and US crude rose 26 cents to $29.90.Japan's Nikkei recouped early losses to rise 0.7 percent, buoyed by a retreat in the yen even as an activity survey showed a drop in new export orders took a heavy toll on manufacturing.The Markit/Nikkei Flash Japan fell to 50.2 in February, from 52.3 in January, a potentially bleak omen for the rest of the region.China's major stock indexes firmed as investors welcomed news over the weekend that the head securities regulator was being replaced.The blue-chip CSI300 index and the Shanghai Composite Index both rose 0.9 percent.While Wall Street ended Friday with a whimper, the major indexes still boasted their best weekly performances this year, with the Nasdaq tallying its strongest week since July.""Equity markets successfully stress-tested and bounced from key technical support last week,"" wrote analysts at RBC Capital Markets.""While we cannot definitively say the cycle/2016 lows are in place yet, the technical evidence continues to suggest a more durable bottom may be forming.""TO LEAVE, OR NOTThe early price activity was in sterling, which beat a hasty retreat as worries that Britain may quit the European Union flared up after London Mayor Boris Johnson threw his weight behind the exit campaign.The pound fell around 1 percent on the greenback, euro and yen. It slid as far as $1.4235 and 160.07 yen, from around $1.4405 and 162.10 late on Friday.Sterling has just about completely reversed gains made on Friday after EU leaders agreed unanimously on a package of measures aimed at keeping Britain in the 28-nation bloc to avoid a potentially disastrous divorce.The other major currencies were steadier. The dollar was a touch firmer at 112.89 yen, as was the euro at 125.45. Against the greenback, the common currency was also slightly weaker at $1.1116.The dollar was underpinned by data last Friday that showed underlying US consumer price inflation accelerated in January by the most in nearly 4-1/2 years.The figures should support the view that the Fed could gradually raise interest rates this year as forecast, though markets remained highly skeptical given the backdrop of slowing global growth and market turbulence.Finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 rich nations gather in Shanghai this week to discuss those global headwinds.There has been some chatter about a possible grand currency agreement that would allow for a depreciation in the US dollar, which might relieve pressure on commodity prices and on emerging markets.However, most analysts consider it very unlikely given so many of the G20 central banks are actively easing policy and need their own currencies to stay competitive.",business

"Gold edged up on Tuesday as Asian shares reversed gains and the dollar slipped, with the metal also supported by big inflows into bullion funds.Asian shares turned negative after rising to a seven-week high as the oil price rally that boosted global equity markets reversed. The dollar index fell from a three-week top.Spot gold had risen 0.7 percent to $1,217.20 an ounce by 0324 GMT. Bullion had fallen as low as $1,201.63 on Monday, when it lost 1.6 percent on the day as equities rallied.Bullion could be vulnerable to more corrections if stock markets strengthen, analysts said.""Prices may stay under pressure at least in the near term,"" said HSBC analyst James Steel. ""Greater investor risk appetite erodes demand for gold, while increased scrap adds to supply as major consumers are shying away from physical purchases.""Top consumers China and India have turned sellers of gold as prices rally. Discounts in India have hit a record high, while prices in China have also turned cheaper relative to the global benchmark, in a sign of waning demand.Gold has gained this year largely on the back of turmoil in stock markets and concerns over the global economy. But the metal has given back some of those gains as markets have stabilised.The volatility index, which measures implied volatility of stock options and is often seen as an investor fear gauge, fell below 20 percent this week, hitting the lowest closing level since early January.HSBC's Steel said the recent decline in gold prices doesn't mean the rally is over, adding that demand for bullion exchange traded funds and possible weakening of the dollar could support the metal.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the top gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 2.64 percent to 752.29 tonnes on Monday, the highest since March 2015.The 19.33-tonne inflow matches Friday's increase, which was the fund's biggest single-day inflow since August 2011.The fund's inflows since the beginning of the year have already surpassed outflows for the whole of 2015.Among other precious metals, silver ticked up after hitting a two-week low of $14.90 an ounce on Monday.

"TOKYO/Asian shares fell on Wednesday as oil prices skidded after Saudi Arabia effectively ruled out production cuts by major producers anytime soon, sending investors into safe-havens such as the yen.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended earlier losses to fall 1.1 percent as of 0246 GMT, slipping further from Monday's six-week high.Japan's Nikkei shed 0.7 percent on the drop in oil prices and as the stronger yen weighed on exporters.Chinese shares opened higher but surrendered the gains, with the CSI 300 index down 0.1 percent and the Shanghai Composite little changed.The US S&amp;P 500 Index fell 1.25 percent on Tuesday to 1,921.27, having failed to rise above its peak hit on Feb. 1, with energy and material sectors being a major drag as oil prices quickly gave up Monday's hefty gains.Saudi Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi told oil executives on Tuesday that markets should not view the agreement by four major oil producers to freeze output at January levels as a prelude to production cuts.While Naimi said he was confident more nations would join the pact, Iran was seen as unlikely to agree to the output cap, which does not allow Iran to regain the market share it lost during sanctions.Oil prices slid in early Asia trade, extending losses of more than 5 percent overnight. US crude futures were down 1.8 percent at $31.29 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent futures were down 1 percent at $32.94.""I suspect few people were expecting a deal to cut production so his comments are hardly a surprise. Yet, the latest development seems to suggest that for oil producers to get more united they will have to feel more pain,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.The toll from low oil prices is also spreading to banks that have exposure to the energy sector, as roughly a third of US shale oil producers are at high risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte.JP Morgan, the largest US bank by assets, said it will increase provisions for expected losses on energy loans by $500 million, or more than 60 percent of its existing reserves.JPMorgan shares fell 4.2 percent on the announcement.Investors instead favoured safer assets such as US Treasuries, with the 10-year notes yield falling to a two-week low of 1.714 percent overnight.The increased risk aversion led gold to erase all its losses from earlier this week to trade at $1,227.30 per ounce, coming near its one-year high of $1,262.90 touched about two weeks ago.In the currency market, traditional safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc outperformed.The yen firmed to 111.77 to the dollar on Tuesday, edging near its 15-month high of 110.985 hit on Feb. 11. It last stood at 111.90.The Swiss franc gained broadly, hitting a one-month high on the euro at 1.09165 franc per euro on Tuesday. It has since weakened to 1.0929 franc per euro.The franc got a lift also as the head of its central bank warned it could not ""endlessly"" take further steps to ease monetary conditions.The euro in contrast was hit by a key index on German business climate showing sentiment among German manufacturers plunged by its largest amount since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Against the dollar, the euro fell to three-week low of $1.0990 on Tuesday and last stood at $1.10160.The British pound remained on defensive, hitting a seven-year low below $1.40 in early Asian trade on Wednesday on worries Britons would vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum.",business

That helped offset investors' fears about record high crude inventories.The sharp downturn in global oil prices has fed investor fears about slowing world growth, with broader concerns about China's cooling economy adding to heightened anxiety and financial market volatility.Brent crude for April delivery skidded 1.1 percent to $34.04 a barrel.Wednesday's recovery in crude oil prices helped drag Wall Street higher at the close, after lackluster economic data weighed on sentiment for much of the session.US data showed the services sector contracted in early February for the first time since October 2013, suggesting a weakening of economic conditions beyond the troubled manufacturing and energy industries. Other data showed weakness in new US single-family home sales, though the overall housing market recovery remains intact.Spot gold erased early losses and rose about 0.4 percent to $1,234.50 an ounce, within site of a one-year high of $1,260.60 reached on Feb. 11.",business
"Crude oil prices dipped in early trading on Friday as reports of a meeting by oil producers to freeze output failed to convince traders that enough effort was being made to rein in ballooning global oversupply.The drop in prices came after oil markets rose late on Thursday on the back of strong US gasoline demand and what ANZ bank called a ""perennial hope that OPEC members can coordinate supply"".That hope was stoked by reports that OPEC-members Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Venezuela, as well as non-OPEC producing giant Russia, would meet in March to discuss capping crude oil production at January levels.But the rally did not last into Friday as traders estimated that a freeze in production would not reduce a glut that has pulled down prices by 70 percent since 2014.International Brent crude futures were trading at $34.89 per barrel at 0139 GMT, down 40 cents from their last settlement. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 21 cents at $32.86.""Capping production at January levels, when the market was pumping out well over a million barrels of crude a day above what consumers need, will in no way reduce overcapacity. In fact, given that Iran has started to return to markets since January, it'll worsen the glut,"" said one senior oil trader.Iran is hoping to increase its crude exports by 1 million barrels per day within the next year after international sanctions against it were lifted in January. The sanctions had cut Iran's exports by more than half from a pre-sanctions peak of almost 3 million barrels per day in 2011.Despite the glut, prices did receive some support this week from strong demand for gasoline, especially in the United States.""The idea that gasoline demand is actually rising suggests that perhaps the lower prices of crude are actually prompting a greater usage of this product (gasoline),"" said Vyanne Lai, oil analyst at National Australia Bank.""I think the market is reading this as a positive sign in terms of demand.""",business

"Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use ""all policy tools  monetary, fiscal and structural  individually and collectively"" to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.""The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it,"" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.""In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it,"" he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to ""consult closely"" on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rate""The US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of ""Brexit"" offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against ""Brexit"" in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.",business

"FRANKFURT/Volkswagen said on Wednesday its top management did not violate market disclosure rules and is taking legal action to fend off lawsuits claiming it had been too slow to inform investors about its rigging of diesel emissions tests.Volkswagen (VW) is mounting its defences in anticipation of a report next month by US law firm Jones Day appointed by the carmaker to investigate those responsible for the biggest corporate scandal in its history.Investors have lodged dozens of lawsuits at the German regional court in Brunswick, claiming that VW failed to disclose its rigging of emissions tests until about three weeks after it had admitted its wrongdoing to US authorities on Sept. 3.VW said it had filed a statement of defence with the court in Brunswick, claiming its manipulations did not have any ""stock price relevance"" until Sept.18 when US regulators announced that the malfeasance had violated environmental rules.""After careful examination by internal and external legal experts, the company confirms its belief that its management board duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law,"" the company said in a statement.The German groups own public admission of the cheating on Sept. 20 subsequently wiped out billions of euros in VWs market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and sparked investigations and lawsuits across the world.Law firm Nieding + Barth said in January it would lodge a case with the Brunswick court, seeking hundreds of millions of euros in damages on behalf of 66 institutional investors from the United States and Britain.Volkswagen said it considered the lawsuits to be without merit.A week ago, the VW supervisory boards top committee hired a German law firm to advise it on the liabilities the carmaker could face as a result of its scandal.More than five months after the emissions scandal broke in the United States, Europes leading carmaker has yet to come up with a technical fix for almost 600,000 diesel cars, and is facing a growing number of legal claims.",business
"Oil futures rose in Asian trade on Friday, buoyed by renewed optimism prices may have bottomed out after official US data showed oil production fell to its lowest level since November 2014.Brent futures nudged up 3 cents to $37.10 a barrel as of 0147 GMT after settling 14 cents higher in the previous session. The crude benchmark is set to end the week with a gain of more than 5 percent.US crude futures had climbed 13 cents to $34.70 a barrel, after settling down 9 cents in the previous session.While US crude inventories rose to a new record of 517.98 million barrels last week, output fell for a sixth straight week to 9.08 million barrels a day, according to data from the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.Cuts in US production are providing price support, but investors are also waiting for key US economic data later on Friday to give further direction, said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress.""A lot of traders are keeping their powder dry in front of non-farm payroll data - it's the number one (indicator) in terms of crude consumers,"" he said.Positive numbers for both February payrolls and US jobs data, both due at 1330 GMT on Friday, could maintain the momentum of higher oil prices, Le Brun said""Investors are a little more confident we've seen a bottom in oil (prices),"" he added.

"FRANKFURT/Volkswagen said on Wednesday its top management did not violate market disclosure rules and is taking legal action to fend off lawsuits claiming it had been too slow to inform investors about its rigging of diesel emissions tests.Volkswagen (VW) is mounting its defences in anticipation of a report next month by US law firm Jones Day appointed by the carmaker to investigate those responsible for the biggest corporate scandal in its history.Investors have lodged dozens of lawsuits at the German regional court in Brunswick, claiming that VW failed to disclose its rigging of emissions tests until about three weeks after it had admitted its wrongdoing to US authorities on Sept. 3.VW said it had filed a statement of defence with the court in Brunswick, claiming its manipulations did not have any ""stock price relevance"" until Sept.18 when US regulators announced that the malfeasance had violated environmental rules.""After careful examination by internal and external legal experts, the company confirms its belief that its management board duly fulfilled its disclosure obligation under German capital markets law,"" the company said in a statement.The German groups own public admission of the cheating on Sept. 20 subsequently wiped out billions of euros in VWs market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and sparked investigations and lawsuits across the world.Law firm Nieding + Barth said in January it would lodge a case with the Brunswick court, seeking hundreds of millions of euros in damages on behalf of 66 institutional investors from the United States and Britain.Volkswagen said it considered the lawsuits to be without merit.A week ago, the VW supervisory boards top committee hired a German law firm to advise it on the liabilities the carmaker could face as a result of its scandal.More than five months after the emissions scandal broke in the United States, Europes leading carmaker has yet to come up with a technical fix for almost 600,000 diesel cars, and is facing a growing number of legal claims.",business
"Oil futures rose in Asian trade on Friday, buoyed by renewed optimism prices may have bottomed out after official US data showed oil production fell to its lowest level since November 2014.Brent futures nudged up 3 cents to $37.10 a barrel as of 0147 GMT after settling 14 cents higher in the previous session.

Meanwhile, ahead of a US Federal Reserve policy meeting, fed fund futures were barely pricing in one more hike this year.Additionally, China's February exports data released in morning trade disappointed analysts' expectations, falling 25.4 percent from a year earlier, while imports fell by 13.8 percent.Still, risk sentiment was broadly upbeat as the impressive rally in commodities markets spilled over into an array of assets such as the high-yielding Australian dollar and mining giant Glencore, which is up 5 percent and 35 percent, respectively in a week.Some investors talked about a potential bottom being formed in the commodity markets as large bearish bets are unwound and hopes of more coordinated measures from oil-producing countries to stem tumbling prices grew.Brent crude futures jumped to as high as $41.04 per barrel on Monday, extending their recovery from a 12-year trough of $27.10 hit in January. US crude futures also rose to $38.11 per barrel, its highest since early January.Further improving the mood in the battered commodity sector, spot iron ore price surged almost 20 percent, hitting a near nine-month high on the back of China's plans to boost short-term output.Ecuador's Foreign Minister, Guillaume Long, said his government will host a meeting in Quito on Friday with Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico ""to reach consensus over oil, especially prices.""In the currency market, investors rushed back to commodity-linked currencies, sending the Australian dollar to as high as $0.7486 on Monday, its highest in almost eight months.The Aussie last stood at $0.7424.The Canadian dollar also firmed to a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3262 per US dollar and last stood at C$1.3290.In Latin America, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Colombian peso all hit multi-month highs.While the dollar was soft in general, major currencies saw limited moves.

"Oil prices dipped on Wednesday, weighed down by a strengthening US-dollar and concerns over slowing demand, although falling US production lent crude markets some support.US crude futures CLc1 were trading at $36.46 per barrel at 0219 GMT, down 4 cents from their last settlement, but still almost 40 percent above February's 2016 and multi-year low.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $39.54 per barrel, down 11 cents from their last close, but still some 40 percent above their January lows for this year.The dips came as the dollar reversed recent losses against a basket of leading currencies overnight, potentially hampering oil demand as imports of dollar-traded crude get more expensive.But analysts said the main reason for the dip in prices and at least temporary end to the rally was concern over faltering demand in China, where the economy is growing at its slowest pace in a generation.""The recent oil rally is looking overextended ... China's export data was horrendous,"" Matt Smith of Clipper Data said in a daily report.China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years.Although China imported record crude volumes of 8 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, analysts expect this figure to fall as the government scales back purchases of strategic reserves, and car sales begin to fall as the sharpest economic slowdown in a generation starts to show results.The price dips at least temporarily halted a price rally that started in mid-February on hopes that a coordinated freeze in production would stop growth in a global supply glut of at least 1 billion bpd above consumption that helped pull prices down as much as 70 percent since 2014.But OPEC-member Kuwait, this week poured cold water on hopes of such a freeze by stating that it would only cap output if all major producers participate, including Iran, which has balked at the plan.One key factor in determining the oil market balance will be US output, which the government said would be 8.19 million bpd in 2017, down from over 9 million bpd currently.But with demand growth also slowing, many analysts including influential bank Goldman Sachs, say that it will take time for markets to fully rebalance.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that it expects ""the annual average (oil) price for 2016 being lower than 2015 and then recovering in 2017, reflecting large oversupply and high stock levels during the first half of 2016"".It added that the main risks to its forecast were changes in demand in China and the extent to which Iran manages to increase oil exports after sanctions against it were lifted in January.",business

"Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday and the dollar firmed as investors braced for policy decisions from major central banks this week, with all eyes on the Bank of Japan's decision later in the day after it stunned markets in January by adopting negative rates.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.7 percent, backing off a 2-1/2-month high on Monday.It was dragged down by a 1.2 percent fall in resource-heavy Australian shares and a 0.7 percent drop in Hong Kong.""Markets are not expecting another round of stimulus so soon after January's surprise from the BOJ and overall sentiment has become more cautious after the recent risk rally,"" said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.With the global economy slowing and many countries facing deflationary pressures, investors' attention was squarely on policy decisions from the world's major central banks.The Bank of Japan is expected to announce its policy decision between 0230-0430 GMT on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank on Thursday.The BOJ is widely expected to keep policy unchanged after its surprise decision in January to introduce negative interest rates raised worries about banks' profitability.Notwithstanding the BOJ's decision, Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citibank, reckons investors are more interested in the Fed statement on Wednesday to gauge how important global vulnerabilities stack up against an upswing in domestic activity for U.S. policymakers.The Fed is unlikely to raise rates this week but it will likely make clear that as long as U.S. inflation and jobs continue to strengthen, economic weakness overseas won't stop rates from rising fairly soon.A consensus in the market is that fresh forecasts from the Fed's 17 officials released after the meeting will signal perhaps two or three rate hikes this year, a retreat from their projection in December for four or more increases in 2016.Financial markets are much more cautious with Fed fund futures are pricing in a 50 percent probability of a rate increase by June and one full rate hike by December.The mood in credit markets also was noticeably more cautious, with investors happy to stay in high quality government debt such as U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rather than venturing into higher-yielding corporate paper.The 10-year U.S. notes yield stood at 1.969 percent, off a six-week high of 1.986 percent hit on Friday.In credit markets too, a recent rally seems to be petering out. An index of high yield credit fell after rising 9 percent over the last month.Even oil prices, whose rebound over the last month triggered a global rally in risky assets, were running out of steam on concerns that a six-week market recovery may have gone beyond fundamentals. U.S. crude stockpiles continue to rise and Iran is seen showing little interest in joining major producers in freezing production.U.S. crude futures last traded at $37.05 a barrel, up slightly from Monday.On Monday, they fell 3.4 percent to $37.18 a barrel, while Brent finished down 2 percent at $39.53.In currency markets, the euro slipped further from its three-week high hit after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated he does not plan further cuts in interest rates.The euro traded at $1.1111, off Thursday's high of $1.1218. The yen was little changed at 113.64 to the dollar while the British pound changed hands at $1.4276, off Friday's three-week high of $1.4437.",business
"Oil prices rose on Wednesday after falling the previous session on expectations US output will decline further as some producers are under increasing financial distress and as early inventory data showed a less-than-expected increase.US crude futures CLc1 were trading at $36.86 per barrel at 0247 GMT, up 52 cents from their last settlement.Brent LCOc1 was up 39 cents at $39.13 a barrel.Oil rose after prices dropped about 2 percent the previous session.Inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday that US crude stockpiles rose 1.5 million barrels last week, less than half of what was expected by an analyst poll, lending markets some support.The US government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) will issue official production and inventory figures later on Wednesday. That data is expected to show crude inventories rose to a record for a fifth straight week.""For today, we may see some strength for prices coming from possible US production declines,"" said Singapore-based Phillip Futures in a note today, although it does not expect US and Brent prices to rise higher than $39.83 and $40.17 per barrel, respectively.US shale producer Linn Energy said on Tuesday that bankruptcy may be unavoidable as the company missed interest payments amid a slump in oil prices of as much as 70 percent since mid-2014.Other companies, also fighting for survival, are seeking risky and costly borrowing from private equity firms.Despite Wednesday's price rises, oil markets remain dogged by a global glut which sees over 1 million barrels of crude pumped every day in excess of demand.And analysts warned that a recent bull-run which saw crude markets jump over 40 percent from multi-year lows earlier this year was overblown and largely driven by speculative traders buying crude from producers who were selling it as a financial hedge.""Producers are not buying the rumour-mill... In fact, it is just the opposite: speculators are buying what producers are selling... Speculators are record long Brent (on ICE) while producers are record short... Who do you think is going to win out?"" said the US-based The Schork Report in a note to clients.Fundamentally, there are few changes to the supply balance.While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to freeze their output at January volumes, near record levels of over 10 million barrels per day (bpd) each, Iran has said it would only participate once its production hits 4 million bpd from a current 3 million bpd.""Any such deal (to freeze output) would still not be a game changer.

Australian stocks added 0.8 percent, South Korea's Kospi rose 1.2 percent and Shanghai was up 0.6 percent.Asian equities took their cue from Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 closed at its highest level this year following the U.S. central bank's cautious message.The Fed concluded a closely watched two-day policy meeting on Wednesday by leaving interest rates untouched, as expected, and signalling fewer rate hikes in coming months as the United States continues to face risks from an uncertain global economy.""Removing interest rate risk from the near horizon has been enough to coax money back into risky assets, but price increases in gold and the depreciation of the dollar would indicate that quantification of the degree of risk still varies greatly,"" said Martin King, co-managing director at Tyton Capital Advisors.Global growth concerns, particularly regarding China, have rattled markets through much of the this year, and this was seen to have influenced the Fed's position.""In our view, the Fed has become increasingly responsive to changes in financial conditions.

"US oil futures touched new highs for 2016 on Friday, adding to strong gains the previous session as optimism grew that major producers would strike a deal to freeze output, while a more benign interest rate environment also supported prices.US crude was up 5 cents at $40.25 barrel at 0211 GMT, after rising as far as $40.55 - its highest so far this year. But the contract also fell to as low as $39.96 earlier on Friday.On Thursday, US crude rose 4.5 percent to close at $40.20, after climbing as high as $40.26.Brent crude's front-month contract was up 1 cent at $41.55. It finished up $1.21 at $41.54 a barrel on Thursday, after earlier reaching the year's peak of $41.60, a level that was matched earlier on Friday.Oil prices have surged more than 50 percent from 12-year lows since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries floated the idea of a production freeze, boosting Brent from about $27 a barrel and US crude from around $26.US oil is heading for a fifth week of gains, the longest rising streak in about a year, while Brent is on course for a fourth weekly increase, the longest run in about 12 months.But some are urging caution after the strong gains.""Global fundamentals are little changed and oil has instead been lifted by higher risk-appetite,"" BNP Paribas said in a note.""A dialogue among key producing countries to address oil output will at best yield a decision to freeze output, but not the much-needed reduction required to rebalance the market,"" BNP said.BNP estimates there will be a 1 million barrel increase in global stocks by the end of the first half of 2016.Still, a weakening dollar after a Federal Reserve policy decision on Wednesday that indicated two US rate hikes this year instead of four is also attracting oil buyers that hold other currencies.OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC producers led by Russia will meet on April 17 in the Qatar capital Doha, aiming for the first global supply deal in 15 years.",business
"Asian shares edged higher on Friday, turning positive for the year, while the US dollar weakened broadly after the Federal Reserve's cautious stance on further rate increases prompted investors to rebuild their bets on riskier assets.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent in early trade, entering positive territory for the year for the first time during Asian hours.That echoed a recovery on Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 Index gained 0.66 percent to close at its highest since Dec. 31, led by the materials and energy sectors.Japanese shares bucked the trend as the dollar's fall against the yen is seen hurting the country's exporters, with the Nikkei .N225 dipping 0.4 percent.The US dollar extended its broad slide triggered by Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement showing the US central bank would raise rates at a slower pace than its previous forecast.""The Fed was dovish in every respect.

"Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif has approved the Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2015-18.The mid-term strategic trade policy framework was formulated through an extensive consultative process spanning over almost a year, keeping in view the current trends in global trading environment and the declining trend witnessed in Pakistans exports during 2015 due to exogenous shocks coupled with domestic factors and inelastic import demand, said a press release of the PM House media wing on Sunday.A Trade Committee (TC) headed by Federal Minister for Commerce has also been established which would monitor the implementation of STPF 2015-18.It would remove bottlenecks, examine issues relating to trade promotion, strengthen international competitiveness and presenting Annual STPF Implementation Report to Cabinet Committee on Production &amp; Exports as well as Federal Export Development &amp; Promotion Board (FEDPB).Learning from the previous two medium term frameworks i.e. STPF 2009 12 and STPF 2012-15 it had been ensured that procedural and budgetary bottlenecks were removed in the STPF 2015-18 to achieve the targets of enhancement of annual exports to US 35 billion, Improvement in Export Competitiveness, Transition from factor driven economy to efficiency driven and innovation driven economy and Increasing Share in Regional Trade through key enablers of Competitiveness Compliance to Standards Policy Environment and Market access.All business processes have simultaneously been formulated and budgetary allocation of Rs 6 billion had been approved to implement the trade policy initiatives for year 2015-16 while continued budgetary support in financial year 2016-17 and 2017-18 has been proposed.Under the STPF 2015-18, a short term export enhancement strategy has also been devised that included the identification of focus products focus markets and market linked focus products.The estimated cost of the short term export enhancementmeasures is Rs 450 million for the year 2015-16 and Rs 1,450 million for three years i.e 2015-18.

"The government on Monday announced the Automotive Policy 2016 carrying incentives and reduced duties for new entrants and existing vehicle manufacturers with the hope to bring in well known international brands to the Pakistani market. Addressing a press conference here Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Asif said the new automotive policy approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) would be valid for five years till 2021.Under the new policy, he said duties for imported parts which were not made in Pakistan would be reduced from 32.5 per cent to 30per cent and for those which were made in Pakistan would be cut from 50 per cent to 45 per cent from next financial year (July 1, 2016).From the financial year 2017-18, duties on locally finished vehicles would be reduced by 10 percent, he added.The minister said the policy was prepared with input form all the stakeholders including ministries of finance, industries and production, Federal Board of Revenue and other players.He said the government acknowledged the contribution of automotive industry in large scale manufacturing.The auto makers could not properly take advantage of a captive market as was done by motorcycle manufacturers.He said under green field investment incentives were provided for installation of new and independent automotive assembly and manufacturing facilities by an investor for the production of vehicles not already being manufactured in Pakistan.Companies would be encouraged to set up new plants and bring equipment without paying duties, he added.He said most manufacturers could only be called assemblers as they were using obsolete technology. The policy was aimed at improving technology and features like air bags, anti lock braking system and fuel efficiency, the minister added.Khawaja Asif said at present Pakistan was not producing any exportable vehicle as the companies lacked international standards.The companies even abandoned deletion programme and were not meeting any engine specifications used worldwide, he added.The minister said the government would continue to regulate and strike a balance between imported cars and local manufactured ones to protect interests of consumers.The government was getting valuable revenue from import of vehicles, he added.He said the consumers were exploited for the last 25-30 years and the new policy tried to protect interest of the buyers.The minister said the policy would protect investment of new entrants and its consistency would be ensured.He said the recall policy for vehicles was also taken into account.Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Dr Miftah Ismail said the closed sick units would be given incentives so that they could begin production. Those who would open plants would get duty exemptions, he added.He said green field investment was aimed at providing a level playing field to new entrants who were required to make huge investment for opening dealerships and setting up plants.If the vehicle market spread to five players instead of the existing three then it could benefit the consumers, he noted.He said the bus and truck manufacturing sector would also be promoted through the new policy.Chief Executive Officer of Engineering Development Board, Tariq Ejaz Chaudhry said an automobile institute would be established and international standards by a forum for harmonization for vehicle regulations Working Party 29 would be adopted to raise standards of the automotive industry.",business
"Spot gold eased on Monday, but found support from a weaker dollar as the US and European central banks kept alive the prospect of cheaper capital for longer.As central bank rhetoric turns more dovish, investors will search for further hints of easing in a week with few data releases to indicate whether years of loose monetary policy are having any material effect.Central banks however are leaving themselves with fewer policy tools, which means there's a diminishing window for fresh upside for gold based on further easing steps, said chief investment officer Jonathan Barratt of Ayers Alliance in Sydney.""In my mind there's still concerns out there on price.""Spot gold edged down by 0.2 percent to $1,252.21 an ounce by 0208 GMT, having finished last week a tad higher. Prices are consolidating below a 14-month peak of $1,282.51 struck on March 11, which was the loftiest since Jan 2015. Prices had slumped below $1,050 a tonne in December.US gold eased by 0.1 percent to $1,253.10.Market indicators are flashing signs that investors see inflation - after it was almost non-existent since the credit crisis - on the rise, despite scepticism from the Fed and the relatively slow pace of US economic growth.Inflation tends to burnish the investment allure of commodities because it consists of a rise in the value of hard assets.Supporting precious metals, the dollar stayed on the defensive early on Monday, having extended its losses for a third week in the wake of dovish signals from the Federal Reserve.Money managers trimmed their bullish gold bets from a 13-month high in the week to March 15, as they also cut a net long position in copper, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.In other metals, platinum and palladium edged down half a percent to $967 and $585.72 respectively.",business
"Most Asian stock markets slipped on Monday after three consecutive weeks of gains as a retreat in oil prices made investors cautious, but losses were tempered by hopes that China may soon cut interest rates again as pressure on the yuan eases.The wobbles in the oil market, a general downturn in commodities and cooling growth in China have rattled financial markets in recent months.Fears about the outlook for global growth were also instrumental in the US Federal Reserve's move last week indicating a slower path for future rate increases.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.3 percent after entering positive territory for the first time this year on Friday. It is up 16 percent from January's lows. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.""Despite the current rally in risk, we are more inclined to be broadly bearish on emerging markets given the underlying weakening trend,"" said Frances Cheung, head of rates strategy, Asia ex-Japan at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.Stocks in China and Hong Kong rose, but equity markets elsewhere in the region edged lower with Taiwan and Australia leading losses.In the absence of any fresh major economic data in a holiday-shortened week, investors were left to ponder the softer tightening bias from the Fed even as the US economic recovery appeared to be gathering fresh steam.Dollar bulls were hit hard last week after the Fed's less hawkish stance which cut the projected rate hikes for the rest of the year by half to only two. Financial markets, as seen by money market futures, are barely pricing in one.Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded doubtful that a recent firming in US inflation would be sustained, suggesting the central bank is in no hurry to tighten policy.Some such as Francis Cheung, China strategist at brokerage CLSA, said the Fed's renewed caution would encourage Beijing to pursue with its own stimulus measures to boost the economy. He expects an interest rate cut in the second quarter.""We see this rally continuing until the second quarter with property materials, internet and industrials sectors in demand,"" CLSA's Cheung said pointing to relatively cheap valuations.On a trailing price-to-earnings basis, the MSCI Asia ex-Japan is trading at 12.3 times, nearly one standard deviation below its 20 year average. At 9.3 times, Hong Kong's stock market was trading comfortably below one standard deviation its 20-year average.China's economy is showing signs of improvement while capital outflows from the country are moderating, top Chinese officials said on Sunday.Easing outflows and the softer dollar are resulting in less pressure on the yuan currency, which could give the central bank more confidence to cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirements again after largely weak data in January and February, some market watchers say.However, softer oil prices dampened sentiment.Oil slipped for a second session, extending Friday's slide of over 1 percent after the US rig count rose for the first time since December, renewing worries of a supply glut after an output freeze proposal had helped boost the market to 2016 highs.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell more than 1 percent to $39.01 per barrel after briefly topping $41, its highest since last December.Brent crude edged lower to $41.04 per barrel after hitting this year's peak of $42.54 per barrel.Rate markets also cheered the Fed's cautiousness with 10-year and two-year US yields down by 14 and 16 basis points since the US central bank's meeting last week.Credit markets basked in the afterglow of the recent rally with an index of high-yield credit extending gains to be up 9 percent in roughly a month.In currencies, the dollar index was little changed at 95.01, not far from a five-month trough of 94.578 set on Friday.The greenback fetched 111.31 yen, still within reach of Friday's 17-month low of 110.67. The euro, which last week scaled a one-month peak of $1.1342, stood at $1.12830.The Australian dollar consolidated gains after hitting its highest level in nine months last week at 0.7681 per dollar.

"Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday as hawkish comments from US Federal Reserve officials clouded the monetary policy outlook less than a week after Fed Chair Janet Yellen had set out a more cautious path to interest rate increases this year.The dollar got a mild boost from the suggestion that interest rate hikes could be on the way sooner rather than later.Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said the central bank might be in line for a rate hike as soon as April, as policymakers' decision to hold rates steady last week was more about ensuring that recent global financial volatility had settled down.San Francisco Fed President John Williams told Market News International he would advocate another hike as early as April, and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said US inflation is likely to accelerate in the coming years and move toward the Fed's 2 percent target.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1 percent, after all three US stock indexes posted small gains overnight.Japan's Nikkei stock index added 2.1 percent, reopening after a public holiday on Monday and getting a tailwind from a weaker yen.""People who bought the yen and sold stocks last week seem to be unwinding their positions,"" said Takuya Takahashi, a strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo.The dollar nursed losses last week after the Fed halved its outlook for interest rate increases to two from four by the end of this year and said an uncertain global outlook posed risks to the US economy. The latest round of official Fed remarks allowed the greenback to take back some of that lost ground.The dollar index, which tracks the US unit against a basket of six major rival currencies, added 0.1 percent to 95.417.The dollar rose 0.1 percent against the yen to 112.11, pulling well away from Thursday's 17-month low of 110.67.The euro edged down slightly to $1.1237, moving away from last week's one-month peak of $1.1342.Sterling inched higher but remained pressured by concerns about Prime Minister David Cameron's ability to keep Britain in the European Union after leading 'Out' campaigner Iain Duncan Smith resigned from the cabinet late on Friday.Sterling was last buying $1.4374, well below Friday's one-month high of $1.4514.""A bit of internal party bickering doesn't normally impact sterling but this time it has because of the possible implications for Brexit,"" Jasper Lawler, market analyst at CMC Markets, said in a note.US crude prices dipped after gaining overnight on data showing a drawdown at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub.Prices fell about 0.3 percent to $41.40 a barrel after rising 1.19 percent in the previous session.

"US oil prices fell in Asian trading on Thursday, adding to a slump in the previous session, after stockpiles rose for the sixth week to another record, sapping the strength of a two-month rally in prices.US crude futures CLc1 were down 10 cents at $39.69 a barrel at 0302 GMT, trading further below the important $40 level.It closed down $1.66, or 4 percent, at $39.79 a barrel on Wednesday. That marked the sharpest one-day drop for the front-month contract in U.S. crude since Feb. 11.Brent crude futures LCOc1 were up 7 cents at $40.54 a barrel, after trading lower earlier in the session. They finished the last session down $1.32, or 3.2 percent, at $40.47 a barrel.Earlier this week, both benchmarks had risen by more than 50 percent from multi-year lows that hit in January.The US government's Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stockpiles climbed by 9.4 million barrels last week - three times the 3.1 million barrels build forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll.The continued rise in stockpiles is grinding away at the gains in prices that were largely driven by plans of major producers, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, to freeze production.""OPEC production is still high and Iran is expected to continue to ramp up,"" said Tony Nunan, oil risk manager at Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo""I expect crude to come back down again and test the $35 level again if we continue to get builds,"" he said.The market was also supported by a release showing crude stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub - an important data point - fell for the first time in seven weeks.Things could get worse for oil bulls, with trading houses betting on oil markets being over supplied for at least two more years and looking to extend or lock in new leases on storage tanks.",business
"Oil prices steadied on Thursday, paring losses after a renewed drop in US oil rigs, but analysts and traders said there could be another selloff in the coming week if US crude stockpiles hit record highs again.Earlier in the day, US crude futures slid 4 percent and Brent below $40 a barrel, extending bearish sentiment from Wednesday when the US government reported a crude inventory build three times above market expectations.But data later on Thursday from oil services firm Baker Hughes, showing US oil drillers cutting 15 rigs this week after a pause last week, boosted sentiment. The US oil rig count now stands at 372, the lowest since November 2009.US crude's front-month contract CLc1 settled down 33 cents at $39.46 a barrel, recovering from a session low of $38.33. For the week, it rose two cents, finishing up for a sixth straight week.Brent's front-month LCOc1 settled down 3 cents on the day at $40.44 a barrel, after an earlier drop to $39.22. For the week, it fell 76 cents, or nearly 2 percent, its first decline in six weeks.Despite the stumble, oil prices remain about 50 percent higher from multi-year lows hit in January from glut worries. While declining US oil output and strong gasoline demand were responsible for some of that recovery, the bulk of it was powered by major producers' plans to freeze output at January's highs.While this week's drop of oil 15 rigs was not a game changer to the market, it offered a reprieve to worries that there was a daily glut of some two million barrels in crude.""After last week's increase of one rig, some may have assumed that the continuing decrease in rig counts was finally abating,"" said Pete Donovan, broker at Liquidity Futures in New York. ""Apparently not so.""Others braced for further price weakness from more US inventory builds.""We see limited bullish assistance to the complex from a fundamental vantage point,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil consultancy Ritterbusch &amp; Associates.Shares on Wall Street, trading in tandem with crude most of this year, also clawed back from the lows of the day, helping oil recover.The dollar meanwhile, erased early gains that made oil and other commodities denominated in the greenback less affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.Volumes in oil were thin ahead of the Good Friday and Easter break, making it easier to retrace losses after sentiment swung.",business

US stock futures ticked up 0.3 percent, although they remain flat for the quarter.The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose 0.2 percent to 96.378, its highest in almost two weeks. The dollar rose 0.6 percent to 113.64 yen, keeping intact its steady recovery from a 6-1/2-month low of 110.67 hit on March 17.That gave Japan's Nikkei a 0.7 percent boost to a 1-1/2-week high.Shares in Korea were little changed, and Taiwan advanced 0.1 percent, while Chinese stocks added 0.6 percent.Share markets in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong were closed for holidays.

The Fed has said the prices will be the key in determining policy so the data should attract a lot of attention,"" said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management.The annual core PCE inflation rose 1.7 percent in January, the fastest pace since July 2014.The data will be followed by a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the economic outlook and monetary policy on Tuesday. A few other Fed policymakers are also due to speak on the same day, making the Fed's policy the biggest focus for now.Given that money markets are pricing in only about a 50 percent chance of a rate hike in June, with hardly any significant likelihood in April factored in, signs of a tightening in the next quarter could rattle financial markets.Oil prices, which have risen about 50 percent since multi-year lows hit in January, extended their gains in thin trading, powered by major producers' plans to freeze output at January's highs.US crude futures gained 0.8 percent to $39.79 per barrel, and Brent advanced 0.8 percent to $40.75.",business

On Monday it settled down 17 cents at $40.27 a barrel.US commercial crude oil stockpiles were expected to have reached record highs for a seventh straight week, while refined product inventories likely fell, a preliminary Reuters survey showed late on Monday.The poll of eight analysts, taken ahead of weekly inventory reports from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA), estimated, on average, that crude stocks rose 3.2 million barrels in the week ended March 25.The API will release its data on Tuesday at 2030 GMT, while the EIA will publish its data on Wednesday at 1430 GMT.Both oil benchmarks are up about 50 percent from 12-year lows hit in mid-February but the oil market has taken on a weaker tone in the past week, along with other commodities.""The numbers continue to suggest a supply glut and I suspect that more talk is relevant out of OPEC and Co to help the price stand up or to help it remain relatively stable,"" said Jonathan Barratt, Chief investment officer at Ayers Alliance in Sydney.He was referring to plans by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other major suppliers including Russia to meet next month to discuss an output freeze in the hope they can support prices.The plans for the April 17 meeting in Qatar have been a major component of the rally.But with stockpiles high and signs that some OPEC members are losing market share, along with few signs of demand returning, prices are likely to trade in a range.""The likes of Russia and the likes of Iran ... are cutting deals left right and centre just to get cash flow,"" said Barratt.""Given the absence of economic numbers supporting increases in demand we continue to go sideways,"" he said.Most analysts are predicting the end of the year-and-a-half long slump, but also betting that there is little upside in the near future.Barclays said net flows into commodities totalled more than $20 billion in January-February, the strongest start to a year since 2011, and prices could fall 20 to 25 percent if that were reversed.""Were such a scenario to unfold, the price of oil could fall back to the low $30s,"" it said on Monday.",business

"MANILA: The Asian Development Bank slashed its economic growth forecast for developing Asia this year, citing global headwinds and a weaker outlook for China.Developing Asia will expand 5.7 percent this year and in 2017, the Manila-based lender said in its latest Asian Development Outlook released on Wednesday.In its December outlook report, the ADB had forecast 2016 growth for the region at 6.0 percent.The region, which groups 45 countries in the Asia Pacific, grew 5.9 percent last year.""Risks are tilted to the downside as tightening US monetary policy may heighten financial volatility, further moderation in China could spill over into its neighbors, and producer price deflation may undermine growth in some economies,"" said ADB chief economist Shang-Jin Wei.The ADB forecast growth in China, the world's second-largest economy, would slow to 6.5 percent this year from 6.9 percent in 2015, its weakest expansion in a quarter of a century. Growth is projected to slow further to 6.3 percent in 2017, ADB said.The bank's 2016 forecast for China, down from a December estimate of 6.7 percent, is at the lower end of Beijing's own target of 6.5-7 percent as the government presses ahead with painful reforms, though Premier Li Keqiang has vowed that would not lead to a hard landing.Weak prices for oil and other commodities also cast a shadow over the prospects of Asia's commodity-dependent economies, the ADB said.In the United States, expanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external demand, the ADB said. US Federal Reserve policymakers have cited continuing risks from a shaky global economy in halving the number of potential interest rate hikes this year to two.Growth in India will slip to 7.4 percent this year from 7.6 percent in 2015, but should recover to 7.8 percent in 2017, the ADB said.For all of South Asia, ADB forecast growth at 6.9 percent in 2016 and 7.3 percent in 2017, versus growth of 7.0 percent last year.Economies in Southeast Asia are projected to expand 4.5 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in 2015, and by 4.8 percent in 2017.For East Asia, ADB sees growth at 5.7 percent in 2016 and 5.6 percent in 2017. The region grew 6.0 percent last year.Central Asia is estimated to expand by 2.1 percent this year and 2.8 percent in 2017, following growth of 2.9 percent in 2015, the bank said.Annual inflation in developing Asia is expected to recover to 2.5 percent this year from 2.2 percent in 2015 as domestic demand strengthens, ADB said. A rebound in global commodity prices next year should lift inflation to 2.7 percent, it said.",business
"Government has ratcheted up prices of petrol and high speed diesel by Rs1.50 and Rs1.40 a litre respectively with effect from April 1.Speaking in Geo News programme Capital Talk hosted by senior anchor Hamid Mir, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said although Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) had proposed a hike of Rs3.09 in petrol price, the government increased it by just Rs1.50 a litre.He said prices of only petrol and diesel are being raised and no change is being made in the rates of other petroleum products.After the raise of Rs1.50 a litre, the new price of petrol will be Rs64.47 while the price of diesel has been pushed up to Rs72.52 with a raise of Rs1.40 a litre.Dar said OGRA in its summary had asked for Rs5.64 raise in per litre rate of kerosene oil but it has been kept unchanged because it is used by people belonging to low-income group.The prices of High Octane Blending Component (HOBC), light diesel and kerosene oil will remain unchanged for the month of April at Rs72.68, 37.97 and 43.25 a litre.",business

"Asian shares edged up to a four-month high on Thursday, taking cues from Wall Street gains overnight, as receding worries of near-term US interest rate hikes continued to buoy risk sentiment.The dollar hovered near seven-week lows versus the euro, still gripped by cautious comments from Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen earlier in the week on monetary tightening.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2 percent, reaching its highest since early December. The index was poised to eke out a gain of 1.2 percent this quarter, which saw equities rocked earlier by global growth worries, but particularly for the Chinese economy.Australian stocks added 1.4 percent and Japan's Nikkei rose 0.2 percent, on track for an 11 percent loss on the quarter. Shanghai shares climbed 0.3 percent, en route to a quarterly drop of 15 percent.Taiwan stocks edged up 0.2 percent, led by gains in iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision after the company approved a deal with Japan's Sharp Corp.Investor risk appetite has increased since Fed Chair Yellen said on Tuesday that the US central bank should proceed cautiously as it looks to hike rates, pushing back against some colleagues who have suggested another move may be just around the corner.""Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech earlier this week is still dragging the dollar down, sparking risk appetite globally,"" said Kim Moon-il, a foreign exchange analyst at Eugene Futures in Seoul.Yellen's views were echoed by Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, who said on Wednesday there was a high hurdle to raising rates in April, given low inflation.Following such cautious views from top Fed officials, the Dow climbed 0.5 percent and the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.4 percent overnight. The CBOE Market Volatility Index, Wall Street's ""fear gauge"", ended down 1.9 percent at its lowest level since August.""Global markets are likely to be dominated by month- and quarter-end flows today as markets await tomorrow's US Institute of Supply Management data, non-farm payrolls and global purchasing managers' indexes, particularly that of China,"" wrote strategists at ANZ.In currencies, the euro fetched $1.1321 , not far from Wednesday's seven-week peak of $1.1365. The common currency was set for a 4 percent quarterly rise. The dollar dipped 0.1 percent to 112.37 yen , headed for 6.6 percent drop this quarter that saw the safe-haven Japanese currency benefit during bouts of global risk aversion.The greenback's recent weakness has been a boon to the Australian and New Zealand dollars, which both soared to nine-month highs.Crude oil prices dipped after U.S. government data showed crude inventories were again at all-time peaks despite strong refinery runs. U.S. crude was down 0.9 percent at $37.99 a barrel and Brent lost 0.5 percent to $39.05 a barrel.Oil prices, which fell to 12-year lows earlier this year, have risen about 50 percent since mid-February after major producers floated the idea of freezing production at January's highs. Some analysts say the rally has breached fundamentals and crude could trade lower.Copper slid as concerns over slowing Chinese demand mounted ahead of Friday's China official purchasing managers' index release. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange slid to as low as $4,829.50 per tonne, the lowest since March 3.",business
"Oil prices jumped more than 10 percent in March in the best quarter since mid-2015 although some analysts said the rally could fade soon as an output freeze plan by major crude exporters fails to alleviate worries of a glut.A weak dollar and data showing a drawdown in crude stocks at the US futures delivery hub helped oil settle steady to firmer in Thursday's session.But traders remained worried that a tentative agreement among the world's largest producers to keep oil output at January's levels will barely make a dent on global supplies.Analysts said crude futures also appear to have overextended gains with a 50 percent rally since the deal was proposed mid-February, amid little improvement in fundamentals.""Oversupply still persists due to resilient US production, even if declining moderately; high OPEC output, led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq; and the gradual return of Iran starting Q1 2016,"" said Mike Wittner, global head of oil research at Societe Generale.Brent crude for May delivery, which expired as the front-month contract, settled up 34 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $39.60 a barrel. June Brent closed 0.7 percent higher at $40.33.The benchmark's front-month soared 10 percent higher in March - its best month since April 2015 - and jumped 6 percent in the first quarter - its best quarter since the second quarter in 2015.U.S. crude futures settled at $38.34, up 2 cents on the day, rising 14 percent in March and 4 percent in the quarter - also its biggest quarterly gain since June 2015.In a Reuters poll, oil analysts raised their average price forecasts for 2016 for the first time in 10 months - Brent averaging $40.90 and U.S. crude $39.70 in 2016 - but cautioned the rally could fade near term.On Thursday, the dollar hit a mid-October low, making greenback-denominated oil more attractive to holders of the euro and other currencies.Data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed a 807,496-barrel drawdown in stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude futures in the week to March 29, traders said.Inventories at Cushing have receded from record highs for two consecutive weeks, with U.S. government data on Wednesday showing a 272,000-barrel drawdown in the week ending March 25.Total U.S. crude stocks, however, rose 2.3 million barrels last week to 534.8 million barrels, a record high for a seventh straight week.OPEC crude output rose in March to 32.47 million barrels per day from 32.37 million bpd in February, a Reuters survey said.Analysts also expect an April 17 meeting of major oil producers in Doha to discuss the output freeze to fall short of expectations.""There is a clear risk of disappointment and for a temporary setback in prices ahead or immediately after the Doha meeting,"" Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.",business

But the health ministry later said the warnings must be adopted on April 1.The panel of lawmakers last month called for reducing the size of warnings to 50 percent to protect the interests of the industry and tobacco farmers.ITC said the health ministrys push to go ahead with its rule was ""contrary to its earlier decision to await the (parliamentary) committees findings"".

"Pakistan Customs is all set to revise up the import trade prices of tyres and tubes in a bid to curb under-invoicing in the monthly $20 million market. The Directorate of Post Clearance Audit-Customs forwarded a reference to the Directorate General of Customs Valuation for re-fixation of customs values or import trade price of tyres and tubes.Preliminary audit findings show that tyres and tubes are being under-invoiced by approximately 52 percent, resulting in a significant revenue loss, said Gul Rehman, Director Post Clearance Audit.Customs value is the transaction value on which the assessment of duty and taxes is carried on.According to the details, the customs department conducted a desk audit of the import of these goods for the period between January 2013 and December 2015, and it was found that the assessment of these goods was made as per the valuation ruling (i.e. customs value applicable at the time of import).However, the values declared by the importers were cross-checked by the transaction value in the exporting country. And, this exercise revealed that value of goods declared to the customs of shipping country at the time of export of these goods is much higher than the invoice value declared before the customs.Directorate General of Customs Valuation is requested to examine the issue carefully to re-fix the import trade price of the subject goods, Rehman said.Under-invoicing is a major source of revenue leakage at import stage. The Pakistan Business Council, in a report, said the country loses around Rs150 billion every year to under-invoicing. Moreover, import of goods at under-invoiced values adversely impacts the local industry. Tyre manufacturers have time and again raised voice against smuggling and under-invoiced imports of tyres and tubes.

"Asian stocks held near three-week lows on Wednesday as concerns about the underlying strength of the Chinese economy dogged investors while oil prices jumped by nearly two percent on growing hopes a global output freeze may materalize soon.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely in positive territory after falling to its lowest level since March. 16. Overnight, it dropped 1.6 percent, its biggest fall in almost two months.While global risky assets has staged a smart recovery since February's lows, led by Chinese stock markets on hopes that Beijing can successfully avert a sharp slowdown, policymakers and investors are worried the recovery may be at best, bumpy, or at worst, short-lived.Alex Wolf, emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments said it is still too early to call an economic stabilization in China because property inventories are still very high and much of the recent economic activity was driven by quasi-fiscal spending.""A rebound based on property exuberance and quasi-fiscal stimulus means it might be more transient than the market wants to believe,"" he said in a note.Data last week showed foreigners are estimated to have pumped $36.8 billion into emerging market stocks and bonds in March, the highest monthly inflow in nearly two years, the Institute of International Finance said.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.01 percent on Tuesday as investors took profits on recent gains ahead of a quarterly reporting season that is expected to reveal sharply lower earnings.In addition, the US trade deficit widened more than expected in February in the latest indication that economic growth in the world's largest economy weakened further in the first quarter.The data prompted economists to cut their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 0.4 percent annualized rate, which would be its slowest growth in two years.Risk aversion was evident in currency and fixed income markets as well.Investors also bought back the yen, a low-yield currency that investors often sell to seek higher yields elsewhere when risk appetite is strong.The yen hit a 17-month high of 109.92 to the dollar on Tuesday after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said countries should avoid seeking to weaken their currencies with ""arbitrary intervention."" It last traded at 110.48.His comments dimmed any prospects of currency intervention by the Japanese authorities to stem the yen's rise in the near future, analysts said.The euro was little changed at $1.1376, hovering not far from its 5 1/2-month high of $1.1438.German 10-year yield fell below 0.10 percent for the first time since April last year, edging near its record low of around 0.05 percent touched almost a year ago.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to a five-week low of 1.715 percent, having fallen almost 0.3 percentage point from its March 16 peak of 2.002 percent.The two-year yield fell to a near six-week low of 0.716 percent while traders reduced bets on a Fed rate hike in June further.Oil offered the sole bright spot in financial markets with prices extending their rebound after Kuwait insisted major producers will agree to freeze output later this month even as key player Iran continued to balk at the plan.The market was also helped by data on US crude supply-demand for last week from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) showing a surprise fall of 4.3 million barrels in inventories in the week to April 1, versus an expected weekly increase of 3.2 million barrels.Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 1.6 percent to $38.48 per barrel, off one-month low of $37.27 hit on Tuesday.

"Crude futures were lifted by a raft of supportive indicators in early trading on Thursday, although some traders warned that physical supply and demand fundamentals did not warrant a strong price recovery at this stage.International Brent futures LCOc1 traded above $40 per barrel in early trading and stood at $40.07 at 0038 GMT, up 23 cents from the last close and almost 8 percent above lows reached earlier this week.Front month US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were trading at $38.09 per barrel, up 34 cents from their last close and 8 percent above their April lows.US crude prices were supported by an unexpected fall in crude inventories, albeit from all-time record highs, last week as refineries continued to hike output and imports fell.""Oil prices spiked after the EIA data release,"" ANZ bank said in a morning note on Thursday.US crude inventories fell 4.9 million barrels in the week to April 1, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels, according to data from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.In Europe, North Sea oil field maintenance expected next month lent support to Brent futures, which are priced off North Sea supplies.And on the demand side, manufacturing seems to be recovering from recent weakness, analysts said.""Global manufacturing PMIs (Purchasing Managers' Index) saw their strongest MoM (month-on-month) recovery in two and half years in March, according to our calculations,"" Macquarie bank said.Yet some traders warned that the rise in futures prices might be premature and not supported by physical market fundamentals.A planned meeting of major oil producers on April 17 to freeze output around current levels, which in most cases remains at or near record highs, would do little to reduce an overhang in production with at least a million barrels of crude pumped every day in excess of demand.""Absent a tightening in global oil fundamentals we reiterate our recommendation to go long put spread,"" BNP Paribas said.A put is a financial instrument that gives a trader the option right to sell an asset like crude futures.",business
"TOKYO/Asian shares extended losses to three-week lows on Friday, while the yen soared to a 17-month high against the dollar as investors bet Japan would be hard pressed to drive down its currency in the face of widespread foreign opposition.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.5 percent, heading for a weekly drop of 1.8 percent.Japan's Nikkei pared earlier losses to near-two-month lows to trade 0.6 percent lower, with financials under pressure.

In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.8 percent, hurt by a drop of more than 2 percent in financials.""When bank shares are making big falls and their CDS spreads are rising like this, obviously you would think something is afoot. If they keep falling in today's session, that is going to be really worrying,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.US stock futures slipped about 0.1 percent further in Asian trade after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen, said the US economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.Despite a chorus of comments from Fed policymakers about more rate hikes, many investors think the global economy is too weak to allow the Fed to raise rates all that fast.The 10-year US Treasuries yield fell to six-week low of 1.685 percent on Thursday, and was last trading at 1.7097. US interest rate futures maintained their firmness, pricing in a less than 20 percent chance of a rate hike in June.Lower yields undermined the dollar, given that prospects of higher US yields were the main attraction behind the currency's firmness.Investors instead bought back the yen which had been long under pressure due to the Bank of Japan's massive monetary easing.""Japan's move towards negative rates, amid a general inability to create substantial nominal GDP and therefore inflation, is now resulting in a wave of JPY buying,"" Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.Traders believe it would be hard for Japanese authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise after the Group of 20 agreement in February warned countries to refrain from competitive devaluation.Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday Japan will take necessary steps on currencies, but declined to comment on the issue of intervention.The yen strengthened to 107.67 to the dollar on Thursday, its highest since October 2014, and last stood at 108.64, heading for a weekly gain of 2.6 percent.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was up about 0.1 percent at 94.583, poised for a flat weekly performance.The euro also hit a six-month high of $1.1454 the previous day and last fetched $1.1361, set to end the week up 0.2 percent.On the other hand, commodity-linked currencies and many emerging economy currencies stepped back from recent multi-month highs as risk-averse mood took hold on investors.The Australian dollar traded at $0.7533, having fallen 1.3 percent on Thursday.In the commodities market, copper suffered its biggest fall in more than six months on Thursday, slumping 2.8 percent on the day and hitting a six-week low of $4,631 a tonne.China may be about to shock the global copper market by unleashing some of its stockpiles of the metal, which are near record highs, on to the global market.The metal was last trading at $4,660 a tonne.Oil prices rose on Friday after firm economic indicators from the US and Germany implied support for fuel demand, but analysts warned another downturn could be on the way due to ongoing oversupply.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 1.3 percent to $39.96 per barrel, set for an increase of 3.4 percent on the week. U.S. crude advanced 1.8 percent to $37.92, on track for a 3.1 percent weekly gain.",business
"The Monetary Policy Committee of the State Bank of Pakistan has decided to maintain the policy rate at six percent.This was announced in the monetary policy statement issued by the SPB here on Saturday.It said that after bottoming out in September 2015 both the Year on Year (YoY) headline CPI and period average inflation are on a rising trend.The monetary policy statement issued by the SBP further stated that while the YoY inflation rose from 1.3 percent in September 2015 to 3.9 percent in March 2016, the period average inflation increased from 1.7 percent to 2.6 percent during this period.Similarly, the YoY core inflation measures kept their increasing trends Non-Food-Non Energy increased for the fifth consecutive month and the Trimmed Mean for the third month.Nevertheless this rise in inflation was anticipated and the benign inflation outlook for the remaining months of FY16 remains largely unchanged.However, these trends in inflation indicate pickup in aggregate demand amid both improved security situation and real incomes.This is reflected in rising demand for consumer durables acceleration in construction activities and expansion in services sector.Continuing increase in fixed investments for the fifth quarter remains noteworthy.<br/>With positive consumer sentiments and incremental lending rates at considerably lower levels the uptake in credit to private sector is expected to end FY16 on a higher level than that of FY15 the SBP, statement added.At the same time with improved business sentiments lower input prices and better energy availability supply conditions have improved as well.Largely contributed by automobile cement and fertilizer sectors large scale anufacturing grew by 4.1 percent in Jul Jan FY16 compared to 2.5 percent growth in Jul Jan FY15.The improving large scale manufacturing and industrial growth trends are expected to continue despite sector specific issues in steel paper and board and sluggish textile sector.Furthermore excess stock of major food items and the February 2016 pass on of lower oil prices to domestic consumers are expected to keep downward pressure on inflation.<br/>This is also corroborated by a decline in inflation expectations in the latest wave of IBA-SBP consumer confidence survey.The SBP statement further pointed out that in line with these developments both money and foreign exchange markets exhibited relative tranquility in recent months.The cushion provided by decline in oil prices, inflow of remittances and calmer international capital markets improved sentiments in the foreign exchange market.As a result in post January 2016 monetary policy period PKR has remained stable in the interbank market.",business
"Global equity markets advanced on Friday, buoyed by a jump in oil prices, but were lower for the week as the dollar gave up early gains against the yen.Stocks on Wall Street and in Europe were lifted by energy names, with Brent and US crude oil jumping more than 6 percent as drawdowns in US crude stocks fed hopes a punishing global glut that has persisted for nearly two years may be nearing a tipping point.Global benchmark Brent crude futures LCOc1 jumped 6.4 percent to settle at $41.94 per barrel, scoring their biggest weekly gain in five. U.S. crude futures CLc1 closed up $2.46, or 6.6 percent, to $39.72, up nearly 8 percent for the week.The Europe Oil and Gas index was up more than 3 percent while the S&amp;P energy index climbed 2 percent as the top-performing sectors in each region, tracking the rise in crude prices.""Clearly if you are looking at it from an index perspective, the stronger commodities are having a bit of a positive effect,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Chicago.""The market still remains very focussed on energy as kind of an indicator of economic health and credit risk that I dont think has faded yet.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,576.96, the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.68 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,047.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.32 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,850.69.Even with Friday's modest gains, the S&amp;P 500 suffered its biggest weekly decline in two months.MSCI's index of world shares rose 0.68 percent but was down 0.55 percent for the week. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed up 1.2 percent, but still notched a fourth straight weekly decline, its longest losing streak since October 2014.Much of the volatility this week has been fuelled by the yen's surge against the dollar, which caught many market participants off-guard and increased speculation Tokyo could intervene in the currency market to halt the rally.The dollar briefly traded above 109.00 yen, recovering from its first break below 108.00 since October 2014 on Thursday. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government would take steps to counter ""one-sided"" moves in the yen in either direction.However, those gains faded late in the session and the dollar was last off 0.04 percent at 108.16 yen, for a weekly fall of 3.1 percent.Sharp appreciation of the safe-haven yen against the dollar is often a warning sign of broader financial market stress and investor risk aversion, which has been exacerbated this week by growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economic and policy outlook.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen on Thursday, said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The comments helped push benchmark 10-year Treasuries down 9/32 in price to yield 1.784 percent after they hit a low six-week of 1.685 percent on Thursday.",business
"Gold jumped to its highest in nearly three weeks on Monday as Asian equities slid and the dollar held close to six-month lows, burnishing demand for the safe-haven metal.Weak economic data and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy have sparked risk-averse sentiment in the market, underpinning demand for safety assets such as gold and the Japanese yen, which is trading near levels not seen since 2014.Spot gold rose to $1,250.46 an ounce early on Monday, its highest since March 22. It later pared some gains to trade up 0.8 percent at $1,249.70 an ounce by 0202 GMT, following its best weekly gain in five weeks last week.""Markets are still jittery about what's going on in the global economy... and gold is the preferred safe-haven,"" said OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan.Gold will remain elevated in the short term, Gan said, but he expected the metal to give back some of its gains later in the year as the Federal Reserve carried out two rate hikes.Higher rates would weigh on gold by lifting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.Waning expectations for further rate increases this year helped gold to its best quarter in nearly 30 years in the three months to March.Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes. The U.S. central bank raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The dollar slid 0.15 percent against a basket of major currencies, falling close to last week's low of 94.015, also the lowest since mid-October.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index fell nearly 2 percent.Data on Friday showed hedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions in gold futures and options in the week to April 5, but still not far from a two-month high.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.22 percent to 817.81 tonnes on Friday.",business

"The newly expanded Gwadar deep-water port in Pakistan that is key to a planned $46 billion Chinese economic corridor is nearly complete and expects</<br/>to process about a million tons of cargo next year, the operator said on Tuesday.Most of the cargo will be incoming construction materials to be used in projects related to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which envisions linking far-western Chinese production regions by road through Pakistan for shipment through Gwadar port to overseas markets.Pakistani security forces have promised to protect the corridor project. ""The port cranes are almost ready, and we are thinking that the port will be (at) full operation by the end of this year,"" said Zhang Baozhong, chairman and CEO of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd.The Chinese company took over Gwadars operations in 2013. The revamped port has three multipurpose berths and its inner is dredged to 11.5 metres. ""Were expecting at least one million tons of material will go in and out"" next year, Zhang said, speaking at a day-long conference in Gwadar city.The projected traffic represents a 100 percent increase over this years throughput, but is a far cry from the 300-400 million tons per year that the Gwadar Port Authority envisions for the facility, which has ambitions of becoming a regional hub.Zhang acknowledged that Gwadar now had minuscule traffic - mostly Pakistani government-subsidised fertilizer imports - but he predicted a swift transformation in coming years.Part of the problem is that the new roads that CPEC is expected to build, linking the port to Chinas industrial zones, have not yet come online and the Pakistani province of Baluchistan does not have enough export-ready products.""Even if you have a very good port, (if) you dont have an inland transporting system and the economy in the near area is not very positive, the port will not be fully utilised,"" he said.He added that his company planned to develop seafood processing plants and other facilities in a 923 hectare free zone outside the port. One of Gwadars main industries is fishing but it is not done on a scale that is suitable for export.",business
"Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Tuesday, but both US and international crude futures held above $40 per barrel ahead of a meeting of major producers to discuss freezing output levels to rein in ballooning oversupply.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were trading at $40.27 per barrel at 0059 GMT, down 9 cents from their last settlement.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $42.70 a barrel, 13 cents below their last close but only 36 cents off their 2016-high reached the previous day.Major oil producers from the Middle East and Russia, but excluding the United States, plan to meet in Qatar's capital Doha next Sunday. They will discuss measures to rein in ballooning oversupply which sees as many as 2 million barrels of crude produced every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold and unwanted fuel.Most analysts expect producers to freeze output around current output levels, which being beyond consumption and close to record levels would do little to address the glut.""The potential risk for prices is for the downside as freezing output at current levels would be more of a symbolic act rather than a real market intervention. But you need to be open to surprises in this market,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.While Spooner said that a production freeze would do little to address the immediate glut, he added that keeping key Middle East and Russian output around current levels might in the longer term lead to a more balanced market.""There is demand growth, and production in the U.S. is falling, so if against that background there was a freeze, markets could get tighter at some stage,"" he said.Analysts at Bernstein said that they expected global oil demand to grow at a mean annual rate of 1.4 percent between 2016 and 2020, versus annual growth of 1.1 percent over the past decade, adding that global demand would reach 101.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020 from 94.6 million bpd now.Looking further into the future, Bernstein said that world oil demand would likely peak in the 2030s.""The world will reach 'peak demand' before 'peak supply'.

"The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday of the risk of political isolationism, notably Britain's possible exit from the European Union, and the risk of growing economic inequality as it cut its global economic growth forecast for the fourth time in a year.In the run-up to the annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D.C. this week, the IMF said the global economy was vulnerable to shocks such as sharp currency devaluations and worsening geopolitical conflicts.In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast global economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, compared to a forecast of 3.4 percent in January. The growth estimate also was lowered in July and October of last year.For 2017, the IMF said the global economy would grow 3.5 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from its January estimate.Its latest report cited a worsening spillover from China's economic slowdown as well as the impact of low oil prices on emerging markets such as Brazil. It also highlighted persistent economic weakness in Japan, Europe and the United States.The gloomier picture sets the stage for the IMF and the World Bank to call this week for more coordinated global action to support growth.""In brief, lower growth means less room for error,"" IMF's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told a news conference, adding that ""scarring effects"" from years of tepid growth could in turn weaken demand, thin the workforce, and reduce potential output further, creating a scenario of ""secular stagnation.""ISOLATIONISM GROWSIn its report, the IMF warned that the rise of nationalist parties in Europe, the June 23 ""Brexit"" referendum, and anti-trade rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign posed threats to the global economic outlook.A British exit from the EU could do ""severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships,"" it said.""We're definitely facing the risk of going into doldrums that could be politically perilous,"" said Obstfeld, who pointed to stagnant wage growth as fueling a growing sense of economic inequality that is spilling into the voting booth in many countries.The IMF urged policymakers to boost growth with actions such as deregulating certain industries and raising labor market participation. It recommended nations with fiscal breathing room boost investments in infrastructure and cut labor taxes, and it encouraged central banks to keep monetary policy accommodative.The IMF's report and the gathering of officials and central bankers in Washington this week comes against the backdrop of widening rows in Europe over negative interest rates, a refugee crisis, and how to shore up Greece's financial bailout program.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the European Central Bank's record low interest rates were causing ""extraordinary problems"" for German banks and pensioners, and risked undermining voters' support for European integration.Official negotiations over Greece's bailout review have been idled during the IMF and World Bank meetings, but the debate over whether to provide more debt relief to Athens in exchange for further budget cuts is expected to continue on the sidelines.Obstfeld repeated the IMF's demand for a bailout program that would put Greece on a path to sustain its debt and begin growing again, adding that there should be some flexibility to help its government deal with the massive numbers of refugees who have fled to Greece from war-torn countries.FORECASTS FOR JAPAN, U.S. ALSO CUTThe IMF on Tuesday cut Japan's growth forecast for 2016 in half to 0.5 percent. It said Brazil's economy would now shrink by 3.8 percent this year versus the previous forecast of a 3.5 percent contraction, as Latin America's largest economy struggles through its deepest recession in decades.Meanwhile, the United States, one of the relative bright spots in the global economy, also saw its 2016 growth forecast cut to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent. The IMF said it anticipated an increased drag on U.S. exports from a stronger U.S. dollar, while low oil prices would keep energy investment weak.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will urge G20 and IMF members to take steps to bolster demand, but also to ""avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and refrain from targeting exchange rates for competitive purposes,"" a senior Treasury official told reporters.The IMF nudged China's growth forecast slightly higher to 6.5 percent this year, and 6.2 percent in 2017, partly due to previously announced policy stimulus moves. However, the Fund added that it was reducing its longer-term growth forecasts for China and said the Asian nation's ""momentous"" shift away from investment-led growth was continuing to chill global trade.",business
"US federal, state and local government agencies rank in last place in cyber security when compared against 17 major private industries, including transportation, retail and healthcare, according to a new report released Thursday.The analysis, from venture-backed security risk benchmarking startup SecurityScorecard, measured the relative security health of government and industries across 10 categories, including vulnerability to malware infections, exposure rates of passwords and susceptibility to social engineering, such as an employee using corporate account information on a public social network.Educations, telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries also ranked low, the report found.Information services, construction, food and technology were among the top performers.Government agencies have struggled for years to keep pace with malicious hackers and insider threats, a challenge that came into focus after it was disclosed last year that more than 21 million individuals had their sensitive data pilfered during a breach at the Office of Personnel Management.SecurityScorecard said it tracked 35 major data breaches across government from April 2015 to April 2016.President Barack Obama has made improving cyber defenses a top priority of his remaining year in office.His administration asked Congress to dedicate $19 billion to cyber security in its fiscal 2017 budget proposal, which would include $3.1 billion for technology modernization at various federal agencies.Federal agencies scored most poorly on network security, software patching flaws and malware, according to SecurityScorecard, which said they may be more vulnerable to risk due to their large size.Of the 600 government entities tracked, NASA performed the worst, the report found.The space exploration agency was vulnerable to email spoofing and malware intrusions, among other weaknesses, according to SecurityScorecards analysis.Other low-performing government organizations included the US Department of State and the information technology systems used by Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington and Maricopa County, Arizona.Government organizations with the strongest security postures included Clark County, Nevada, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the Hennepin County Library in Minnesota.",business

"Pakistan Customs proposed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to impose five to 20 percent regulatory duties on a number of importable goods to avert the incidences of mis-declaration, which cause revenue losses to national exchequer.Various statutory rates of import duty, under the FTA (free trade agreement) regime provide opportunity to the importers to get items cleared under the minimum duty slab, said the Customs Appraisement South, in its budget proposals for 2016/17. It is, therefore, proposed that regulatory duty be enhanced to 15 percent from existing 10 percent on import of woven cotton fabric.There are various rates of import duty on similar goods with only structural formation difference. Generally, the importers declare goods with vague and fake descriptions to claim the minimum duty slab.It is proposed that regulatory duty be imposed on goods importable under lower duty slabs to rationalise the duty structure, said the Customs Appraisement South.The department advised the FBR to specify same concessionary rate of sales tax on raw materials and goods imported by manufacturers/industrial consumers as well as commercial importers.Commercial importers as well as industrial consumers should be given same rates of sales tax as it is difficult to check genuine manufacturers at import stage, it said.According to a statutory regulatory order (1125(I)/2011), sales tax is charged at three percent on industrial inputs imported by manufacturers of the five export-oriented sectors. In case of commercial importers, value addition tax of three percent is also charged in addition to one percent sales tax at the import stage.A majority of the commercial importers have managed to got themselves registered as manufacturer with a view to misuse the SRO, resulting in revenue loss, the budget proposals document said.For example, it added that the balance of imports of textile yarn has abnormally shifted in favour of manufacturers from commercial importers.The Customs Appraisement South also proposed the FBR to withdraw duty and tax concessions available to the aviation industry.Presently, duty concessions are available on import of ground handling equipment, service and operation vehicles, catering equipment and fuel trucks, not manufactured locally and imported by domestic airlines or by any other service company to which a licence has been issued by the Civil Aviation Authority for such purposes.

"SINGAPORE/Oil prices tumbled 5 percent early on Monday after a meeting by major producers in Qatar fell apart the day before, leaving the world awash with unwanted fuel.International benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at $40.86 per barrel at 0029 GMT, down 5.2 percent since their last settlement.US crude futures were down 5.7 percent at $38.06 a barrel.Some 18 oil exporting nations, including non-OPEC Russia, had gathered in the Qatari capital of Doha for what was expected to be the rubber-stamping of a deal to stabilise output at January levels until October 2016.But the deal fell apart after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in despite calls on Riyadh to save the agreement and help prop up crude prices.""The failure is negative from the psychological point of view. It shows the inability of all sides to cooperate,"" said Gary Ross, the founder and executive chairman at New York-based consultancy PIRA.The development will revive industry fears that major producers are embarking again on a battle for market share in a world already awash with unwanted oil, especially after Riyadh threatened to raise output steeply if no freeze deal were reached.As a result Brent would likely average $36 per barrel during the second quarter of this year as a global glut continued unabated, it said.""This meeting and its outcome should have built confidence that the oil market rebalancing was close at hand, as well as building a circle of trust among producers for possible future cooperation and coordinated action.

"BRUSSELS: European Union countries should consider taking tougher measures against banks and tax advisers who help their clients to hide money offshore, an EU Commission paper says.The document will be discussed at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Amsterdam on April 22-23, where tax evasion has been added to the agenda following the Panama Papers leaks.""The Panama Papers have highlighted how certain European financial intermediaries and other providers of tax advice appear to have actively helped their clients to conceal money offshore,"" the document, seen by Reuters, said.Banks are already subject to financial sanctions and a possible withdrawal of their operating licences if they breach EU anti-money laundering rules.The Commission wants finance ministers to consider ""more effective disincentives"" for lenders and other tax advisers who assist in tax evasion schemes, the document said.The EU executive is reviewing anti-money laundering rules and is expected to make legislative proposals by June.Under consideration are also plans to increase transparency on the ultimate ""beneficial"" owners of companies and trusts, which often are hidden, thus allowing tax evasion.Current rules oblige EU states to set up registers of firms owners, but do not require public disclosures.Trusts are at the moment subject to lower transparency requirements.""It would be worth considering whether improvements are possible to enhance accessibility of beneficial ownership registers, to clarify the registration requirements for trusts,"" the EU Commission paper said.The Commission this year proposed measures to tackle tax dodging, urged large companies to reveal their tax data and called for a EU list of tax havens which should be subject to common sanctions.Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis called on EU states to make ""substantive progress"" on all these issues in a letter sent to the Dutch presidency of the EU ahead of the Amsterdam finance ministers meeting.",business

A strike in Kuwait temporarily slashed the country's oil output by more than half, and helped pull crude prices off their lows.Brent crude was up about 0.1 percent at $42.97 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.5 percent to $39.96.""Oil started the day sharply lower after key producers failed to reach an agreement to freeze production but the losses were short lived as reports of a strike in Kuwait sparked a U-turn that briefly took prices into positive territory,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said in a note to clients.That helped commodity-linked currencies come roaring back to life after steep losses following the Doha deal breakdown.The Australian dollar was last up 0.4 percent at $0.7775 after earlier rising as high as $0.7778, its highest since June. On Monday, it had skidded as low as $0.7594.The perceived safe-haven yen slumped in line with the recovery in risk appetite. The dollar added 0.3 percent to 109.12 yen, while the euro added 0.3 percent to 123.35 yen, moving away from the previous session's three-year low.Against the dollar, the euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.1306, as investors looked ahead to the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. While no change is expected, investors are awaiting Mario Draghi's news conference for clues on the central bank's thinking.The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet next week, and is also expected to hold pat on policy, though any suggestion that more hikes are on the way sooner rather than later would lift the greenback.New York Fed President William Dudley said in a speech on Monday that economic conditions are ""mostly favorable"" yet the central bank remains cautious in raising interest rates because threats loom.For the second time in as many weeks, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren warned on Monday that futures markets, which see only one modest rate hike in each of the next few years, are off the mark.",business
"Asian shares reached six-month peaks on Wednesday as a falling US dollar and fading concerns about China lifted commodity prices and risk appetite generally.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.4 percent to territory last visited in early November.

The chipmaker lowered its revenue forest and said on Tuesday it would cut 12,000 jobs globally.Oil prices continued their recent see saw pattern, easing back in Asia after rising strongly on Tuesday. Brent crude lost 58 cents to $43.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude oil eased 73 cents to $40.35.Prices had gained as a strike in Kuwait cut production by 1.7 million barrels per day, partially offsetting the failure by oil producers to agree on an output freeze.Copper, iron ore, gold and silver all held hefty gains, with gold reaching $1,250.20 an ounce. That helped lift commodity currencies, and the Australian dollar notched a high not seen since June at $0.7827.Yet the US dollar still rallied on a weakening yen to reach 109.22, up from Monday's trough of 107.75.The euro edged up to $1.1358, from a low of $1.1234 set last week. Traders said much now depends on the outcome of the European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting on Thursday.In March, ECB chief Mario Draghi unleashed an aggressive package but muted its impact by suggesting there would be no further cuts, giving the euro and unwelcome boost.""Outside of some verbal discomfort at the euro's strength and reiteration that the ECB stands ready to take further action if necessary, it is difficult to see what he can do,"" analysts at ANZ wrote in a note to clients.""The risks of a further squeeze higher in EUR/USD are significant,"" they added.",business

With Brent up 8 percent since Monday and WTI 12 percent higher since April 18, this week is set for some of the steepest price rallies so far this year, and crude is up by more than two-thirds since its 2016 lows between January and February.Traders said that sentiment in the entire commodity complex had turned more confident, with new cash being put into the market by investors, lifting prices.Another factor has been producers taking advantage of higher prices by locking in production. ""We would expect producers in the U.S. taking every opportunity to aggressively hedge as soon as there is opportunity when oil prices recover for short periods of time,"" French investment bank Natixis said.Falling output, especially in the United States, where many producers are shutting down following an up to 70 percent price<br/>rout since 2014, is also helping to lift the market.Natixis said it expected U.S. oil production to drop by at least 500,000 to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) this year, compared with 2015, and by another 500,000 bpd in 2017.Despite the recent rally, oil markets remain oversupplied as<br/>between 1 and 2 million barrels of crude are being pumped out of the ground every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel.",business

"Oil prices fell early on Monday as traders took profits after three weeks of gains and as a jump in the dollar late last week was priced into fuel </markets.Front-month Brent crude futures were trading at $44.66 per barrel at 0043 GMT, down 45 cents, or 1 percent, from their last settlement. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down around half a dollar, or 1.2 percent, at $43.22 a barrel.Analysts said the price drops were largely a result of cashing in after three weeks of rising prices. ""I guess (theres been) some profit taking after a strong<br/>rally into the end of last week,"" said Virendra Chauhan of Energy Aspects in Singapore.Market data shows that the amount of open positions betting on rising WTI prices rose to levels last seen in June 2015 last week. At the same time, the amount of deals taken out in expectations of falling prices fell close to 2016 lows and levels prior last seen in the second quarter of last year.""If the selling pressure lasts through today, I suspect therell be a bit of a dent in the newest data when it gets released tomorrow,"" said one crude trader.A jump in the dollar on Friday against a basket of other leading currencies on expectations that Japan will further extend its aggressive monetary easing through negative interest rates, also dented oil.A stronger dollar, in which oil is traded, makes fuel imports for countries using other currencies more expensive, potentially hitting demand. Mondays early oil price drops came despite another decline in the US rig-count that brings activity down for a fifth straight week and to levels last seen in November 2009.A total of 343 rigs were drilling for new oil last week.That compares to over 700 this time last year, according to oil services company Baker Hughes Inc on Friday.

"Automakers in China face a war of attrition in the market for environmentally friendly cars as tighter regulations force heavy spending on development and production while a slowing economy leaves the demand outlook hazy.Top vehicle manufacturers from around the world laid out plans for new green offerings at an auto show that kicked off here Monday -- a massive event featuring more than 1,600 companies and nearly 1,200 new models.Volkswagen, still struggling to recover from an emissions scandal, was in the spotlight early on. It will invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2016 alone in such areas as environmental and safety technology, said Jochem Heizmann, who heads the German company's operations here.China is VW's most important market. With the government planning to adopt the world's toughest emissions regulations in 2017, the automaker intends to roll out 15 eco-car models over the next three to four years. It will begin full-scale production of a plug-in hybrid based on the Golf around 2018.Toyota Motor plans to build a plug-in-hybrid version of the Corolla starting that year. The company arranged the rollout schedule to coincide with a number of planned launches of plug-in hybrids by other automakers, said Hiroji Onishi, head of China operations.Honda Motor will begin production of an Accord hybrid this July and release a plug-in hybrid in 2020. Market leader General Motors plans to spend 100 billion yuan ($15.3 billion) over the next five years to promote sales of electric and other vehicles.China led the world in new-car sales for a seventh straight year in 2015, at 24.59 million vehicles.

The more tame Fed tightening cycle, compared to expectations last year, should also support gold,"" Steel said.MKS Group trader Sam Laughlin said support around $1,230 should keep the metal buoyant, though gains will be limited by the Fed announcement on Wednesday.Speculation of further easing sent the yen reeling against the dollar late last week, but uncertainty over whether the BOJ will actually deliver fresh stimulus at its April 27-28 meeting saw the Japanese currency recover some ground.The Fed also holds a policy meeting this week, with the two-day gathering kicking off on Tuesday. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at the meeting, but markets will be looking for its take on the global economy and its monetary policy outlook.Economists expect the Fed to deliver a rate hike in June, and follow up with another by year-end.

"Irans oil exports to South Korea have more than quadrupled to 400,000 barrels a day since international sanctions were lifted in January, Oil Minister<br/> Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying on Sunday by the Shana news<br/> agency.Iran, whose exports to South Korea were less than 100,000 barrels a day before sanctions were lifted, has since worked to quickly boost its output.It has focused on selling to its traditional customers in Asia, but has also shipped cargoes to Europe.According to data from Energy Aspects, global imports of Irans crude rose in March to 1.90 million bpd, from 1.51 million bpd in February.Zanganeh also said Iran and South Korea were working to resolve difficulties in transferring payments for the oil sales, alluding to the continued reluctance of international banks to enter the Iranian market.Most international sanctions were lifted in January under last years nuclear deal, including those targeting the oil sector, but some U. S. sanctions and a U.S.trade embargo remain in place.",business
"Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has criticized the executive board of scandal-ridden carmaker Volkswagen for not waiving bonuses despite bringing the company to the brink of collapse.""I have no sympathy for managers who first drive a large blue chip-listed company into an existence-threatening crisis and then defend their own bonuses in a public debate,"" Schaeuble told German weekly Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. ""That shows that something is not working.""Volkswagen plans to pay the 12 current and former members of its management board 63.24 million euros ($72.44 million) for 2015, a year when Europe's largest carmaker posted a record loss due to legal and compensation costs for cheating diesel emissions tests.The company withheld a small part of bonus payments but will award them at a later date if certain performance criteria are fulfilled, including a recovery of the Volkswagen's share price.The bonus payouts have sparked public outrage in Germany and a spat within Volkswagen's supervisory board.Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, had called for executive bonuses to be scrapped or cut as Europe's largest automaker counts the multi-billion-euro costs of ""Dieselgate"".Joerg Bode, a former supervisory board member who had represented Lower Saxony, told weekly Welt am Sonntag that ex-CEO Martin Winterkorn and his colleagues should pay back the part of the bonuses that had been generated by ""cost cuts through fraud"".Current supervisory board member Bernd Osterloh said last week that the carmaker should look beyond contractual obligations and that the management board should volunteer to cut their bonus payments. ""It is also about morals,"" he had said.Osterloh also said that the supervisory board should also discuss changes to its own remuneration system once the dieselgate scandal has been resolved.""As soon as business is back to normal we should think about changing the (remuneration) system (of the supervisory board),"" Osterloh was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying.A swift change to fixed salaries and abolishing variable pay components tied to dividends would be a wrong signal as that would effectively lead to a hike in remuneration, the Volkswagen labor chief told the paper.Following its record 2015 loss VW had slashed its dividend to 0.17 euros per preferred share from 4.86 euros.",business

"Oil prices dipped in early Asian trade on Monday as rising production in the Middle East outweighed falling US output and the recent slide in the dollar, which has been supporting crude.Brent futures were trading at $47.05 (32 pounds) per barrel at 0028 GMT on Monday, down 32 cents from their last settlement. US crude was down 28 cents at $45.64 a barrel.Analysts said rising output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and especially the Middle East was outweighing supportive factors such as an ongoing, albeit slow, fall in U.S. output and a sliding dollar, which makes it cheaper for countries using other currencies to import dollar-traded fuel.""The weaker dollar failed to excite investors in the crude oil markets,"" ANZ bank said, citing a rise in OPEC-output as the main downward driver for prices.The dollar has fallen over 6 percent this year against a basket of other leading currencies.French bank BNP Paribas said that a recent oil rally, with prices jumping almost a third since April, was largely driven by sentiment and lacked physical fundamentals.""The recent rally in oil prices ... appears to have little to do with fundamentals,"" it said.""We see the recent rally as sowing the seeds of its own demise, and extending our recommendation to protect against short-term downside risk.""OPEC-supplies rose to 32.64 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, from 32.47 million bpd in March, according to a Reuters survey based on shipping data and information from sources at oil companies, OPEC and consultants.That almost matches January's 32.65 million bpd, when Indonesia's return to OPEC boosted production to records.Despite Monday's lower prices, other analysts are growing confident that a near-two-year rout in oil has ended, and many have raised their price forecasts.The chief of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oil prices may have bottomed out, providing the health of the global economy does not pose a concern.""In a normal economic environment, we will see the price direction is rather upwards than downwards,"" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.Non-OPEC output is set to fall by more than 700,000 bpd this year, the biggest decline in around 20 years, he said.With global oil demand seen growing by 1.2 million bpd this year, the draw in global stockpiles will start soon, helping push up prices, he said.",business

"Pakistan has been successful in establishing and growing its apparel manufacturing industry, however, more can be done to realize its potential as a regional hub and to continue to boost opportunities, especially for women and the poor, according to a new World Bank report.The Stitches to Riches Apparel Employment Trade and Economic Development, launched in Pakistan today, is aimed at demystifying the global and South Asian apparel markets, estimating the potential gains in exports and jobs and identifying policies that can unleash country s export and job potential compared with those of their closest competitors in the Southeast Asia region  Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.The report finds that it is important for South Asian economies to remove existing impediments and facilitate growth in apparel to capture more production and create more employment as wages rise in China.The successful manufacturers will be those who can supply a wide range of quality products to buyers rapidly and reliably,not just those who offer low costs.China currently dominates global apparel trade but that may change in coming years due to the rising prices in China.Investors are compelled to seek out apparel firms in other countries. The potential decrease in Chinese exports presents a huge opportunity for South Asian countries.A 10 percent increase in Chinese apparel prices would increase apparel employment in Pakistan for males by 8.93 percent,by far the biggest winner,followed by Bangladesh 4.22 percent and India 3.32 percent.Women are also expected to benefit the most as their share in the total apparel employment is much higher than their share in other industries. This is true for Pakistan as well.The report finds that 1 percent increase in expected wages in Pakistan would raise the probability of women entering the labor force by 16.3 percent. Job creation is among the governments top priorities.Apparel manufacturing presents the poor with job opportunities in Pakistan, especially for females, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.These employed women would in return spend more on the health and education of their children which will contribute towards the larger development goals of the country.Pakistan has a fastgrowing apparel sector that accounts for 19 percent of its exports and firms are competitive with global exporters in terms of prices.Yet despite low prices in most apparel product categories, Pakistan lags competitors in reliability and policy continuation. It also remains highly concentrated in cotton products.South Asia has taken many steps in recent years to support the textile and apparel sector but it now needs to step up its game by tackling inefficiencies that are undercutting its competitiveness, says Gladys C LopezAcevedo, one of the authors of the report and a Lead Economist for the World Bank.Pakistan should use this opportunity and implement policies to become a regional leader in creating good jobs, bringing more women into the work force and diversifying its products and end markets to increase skills and value.The report suggests that Pakistan could benefit from the following policies. Increase product diversity by reducing barriers on imports to ease access to man-made fibers such as duty and tax remission for exports and export processing zones.",business
"Pakistan is wooing foreign car makers like Renault and Nissan with generous import duties, but convincing them to set up factories will be an uphill challenge given fears about the country's long-term political stability and security.Pakistan wants to shake up its Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki, whose locally assembled cars are sold at relatively high prices but lag behind imported vehicles in terms of quality and specifications.To do that, analysts say, the government must convince manufacturers that the country has turned a corner after a decade of economic turbulence and a series of major attacks by militant groups including the Taliban.With the economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years, the local currency stable against the dollar and interest rates at their lowest in 42 years, Pakistani officials believe the country is once again on the radar of investors seeking to tap into a market of nearly 200 million people.Officials are touting a new auto policy, skewed in favour of new entrants, that includes offering foreign car manufacturers lower duties as an incentive to set up plants in Pakistan or revive shuttered ones.""We expect that there will be one or two foreign investors coming into Pakistan,"" said Miftah Ismail, chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, who has been talking to car makers about setting up assembly plants for the local market.Ismail told Reuters he had held talks with Japan's Nissan and France's Renault for ""some time"", and last month met Fiat executives in Italy for the first time.Previous discussions also involved Germany's Volkswagen.""I hope some people will bite,"" he said.A source close to Renault said Pakistan was under consideration for new production investment, along with other potential locations, but added that discussions were at a very early stage. In an e-mailed statement, the company said it had ""no news to announce at this time"".Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said: ""Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present"", but added no final decision had been made.STABILITYAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalising deals, despite the concessions on offer.A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability.The threat of militant attacks also remains high, despite the armed forces' long-running campaign against groups including the Taliban.Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long-term outlook is so uncertain.""There is potential in Pakistan. There is no doubt about that,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at consultant IHS Automotive. ""(But) we really don't feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition, from a mid to long-term perspective.""Another potential turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan's car market, where 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighbouring India.""The Pakistan market is not big enough,"" said Mumshad Ali, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts.He added that the government's new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers, nor did they address ways to increase demand, such as lowering sales taxes.The local manufacturing partners of Suzuki, Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.But Ali said they felt aggrieved that the government was favouring new investors and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing factories.Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free. Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at 10 percent, while existing players will have to pay 30 percent.""We want greater competition, and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices,"" he said.Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars, which tend not to have airbags, anti-lock breaking systems (ABS) and other features considered standard elsewhere.The cheapest Pakistani car, the Suzuki Mehran, sells for 650,000 Pakistani rupee ($6,200), or about double the price of a comparable model in India.""Local cars are so bad,"" said Ali Paracha, owner of a car rental company.

India also need to extend access to Pakistani products with preferential duty regime, the minister added.The minister also informed the delegation that the ministry has restructured National Tariff Commission (NTC) in line with the legal framework guided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.Earlier, the delegation was of the view that Indian food manufactures are looking for different Pakistani agriculture products, like Mango and Kinno in specific seasons.Also they added Pakistan agriculture products, like green peas, can be exported to India as they run freezing plants at far less capacity of 200,000 tons.The business interlocutors were of the view that trade with both countries should cooperate in promoting SME, Agriculture, Tourism, Culture, Research sectors Basmati Rice, branding issue and exchange of business groups visits.Later, a delegation of Pakistan Commercial Exporters Association called on Minister for Commerce with an agenda to boost exports in Gems and Jewelry products.Assuring full support to the business group, the minister said government shall move further ahead in increasing exports and soliciting resources until exports fraternity come forward and take initiatives and mobilize their resources.",business
"Higher food and fuel prices probably nudged India's annual inflation up to 5.0 percent in April from 4.83 percent in March, according to a Reuters poll, making it harder for the central bank to follow up last month's interest rate cut too swiftly.The consumer price data INCPIY=ECI is due to be released at 1200 GMT on Thursday.""The central bank has to be confident of hitting the 5 percent target next year before deciding on easing further,"" said Rishi Shah, economist at Deloitte.Shah expects inflation to rise to 5.20 percent in April, though the median forecast from the survey of 27 economists was 5.0 percent.Last month, Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan cut the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent, the lowest since 2011.A recent Reuters poll predicted only one more interest rate cut in 2016, most likely toward the end of the year.""Unless inflation really surprises on the downside, we don't see much happening and the focus should be on liquidity rather than interest rates for now,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities.Above-average monsoon rains are expected this year and should spur rural demand as two-thirds of India's population depends on farming for its livelihood.""The monsoons will play an important part in determining growth by giving a boost to rural demand in the industrial sector, as we believe that a more sustained increase in investments is still some time away,"" Shah said.The latest poll also showed industrial output INIP=ECI grew 2.5 percent in March, faster than 2.0 percent the month before.That quickening in pace is mostly due to a surge in infrastructure output, which accounts for over one-third of the wider industrial measure and hit a 16-month high in March.",business
"Pakistan must speed up reform of the energy sector and bring more women into the labour force if it wants to quicken economic growth that lags far behind regional peers, the World Bank's country representative said on Monday.The World Bank expects Pakistan's economy to expand by 4.5 percent in 2016, missing the government's 5.5 percent target and trailing behind other South Asian nations where growth is expected to average about 7 percent this year.The bank sees 2017 growth edging up to 4.8 percent in Pakistan, a nation of 190 million people. Experts say the economy needs to expand by at least 6 percent a year to absorb new entrants to the work force.Illango Patchamuthu, the World Bank country director, said Pakistan had benefited from a collapse in global oil prices and tough fiscal measures by the government over the past few years to stabilise the economy.But he urged faster reform in the energy sector, which has suffered decades of under-investment. Businesses say frequent power outages hurt growth and investment.""To me, the whole story around power reforms is still only half done,"" Patchamuthu told Reuters in an interview.He said Pakistan must tackle its so-called circular debt problem, which stems from unpaid government subsidies that build up until power plant owners cannot afford fuel. It stands at about $3 billion.The government expects its electricity rationing system of ""load-shedding"" to end by 2018 after it signed more than $30 billion in energy generation projects as part of the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Project.But efforts to privatise a host of electricity distribution companies have stalled, as have other reforms.Patchamuthu said the government has been focused on power generation, but it must also seek to improve distribution and upgrade ancient transmission systems.""A lot more needs to be done in the next several years to build up the whole power infrastructure,"" he said.Patchamuthu said another way for Pakistan to significantly boost growth is reforming its male-dominated labour market, where women account for only 22 percent of the workforce.""If Pakistan wants to get to 7-8 percent (growth) with structural reforms, they also have to much more in drawing women into the labour force,"" he said.""There are social and cultural challenges,"" Patchamuthu said.

"Oil prices were steady on Tuesday as brimming inventories and a looming refined products glut offset supply disruptions in Canada and elsewhere that have taken more than 2 million barrels a day of production out of the market.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at $43.70 per barrel at 0315 GMT, up 7 cents from their last settlement.U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading at $43.34 per barrel, down 10 cents.Canadian officials who got their first glimpse of the oil sands town of Fort McMurray since a wildfire erupted and knocked out over 1 million barrels of daily crude production said almost 90 percent of its buildings were saved.Despite the improving conditions, producers expect shutdowns of several weeks as facilities like pipelines that were close to the fires need to be inspected, while evacuees need to leave production plants before staff can return.Outages in Canada and around the world now amount to more than 2 million barrels of lost daily output since the beginning of the year, virtually erasing a glut that emerged in 2014 and pulled down prices by as much as 70 percent before a recovery started earlier this year.Goldman Sachs said it expected a decline in U.S. oil production by 650,000 bpd this year.BMI Research said that production in Asia was also falling: ""We anticipate combined crude oil production in the region's largest producers, namely China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia, to fall by 4.9 percent in 2016 (equivalent to 331,500 bpd) as low oil prices and upstream spending cuts weigh on overall output.""Adding Canada's disruptions to declines in Latin America and Africa, overall output has likely fallen by over 2 million bpd this year.Yet traders said they were re-focusing on brimming U.S. inventories, which are expected to hit records despite the disruptions from Canada, which exports most of its crude to the United States.U.S. commercial crude stockpiles likely rose last week for the fifth straight week, a Reuters poll showed, with total U.S. crude inventories seen to have built by 500,000 barrels to a record high above 543 million barrels.Some traders said a $40-$50 per barrel price range may reflect a balanced market with plentiful stocks.However, with plenty of crude available, refiners have produced large volumes of gasoline and diesel, threatening to overwhelm demand despite the coming U.S. summer driving season.If that happens, refiners will lower their output and cut orders for new crude feedstock, putting downward pressure on prices.",business

"Indias gold imports could hit a record high this year amid widespread smuggling to sidestep government levies on overseas shipments, Australia and New Zealand Bank, Asias biggest shipper of physical gold, said on Wednesday.The forecast by the banks head of precious metals, John Levin, runs counter to tallies that show gold imports in decline in the worlds second-biggest gold market after China.Levin said he expects 15 percent of Indias gold this year to be ""smuggled in"" or arrive via ""other unofficial channels"" to beat a 10 percent levy imposed by the government.Levin also said more semi-refined gold, known as gold dore, was being imported from overseas mining companies because of a lower government levy.The import duty on gold dore is 8.5 percent.""You could see a record amount of gold going into India this year,"" Levin said, ""A lot through unofficial channels and a lot of it going in as semi-refined gold.""However, industry officials say unofficial imports are also coming down as Indian market prices trade at a discount to the U.S. dollar spot price.As recently as a few weeks ago, Indian importers were offering discounts as high as $40 per ounce, or nearly 3 percent of the value to attract buyers.This has been discouraging smugglers as their margins have been squeezed, Daman Prakash Rathod, a director at MNC Bullion, a wholesaler in the southern Indian city of Chennai, said on Wednesday.Officially, Indias gold imports in the 2015/16 fiscal year that ended on March 31 dropped 16 percent from a year ago to 926 tonnes.ANZ last year handled about 15 percent of the worlds gold shipments, according to Levin.",business
"The world is getting an object lesson on the problems of having one dominant global currency and even the supposed prime beneficiary, the United States, can see the downside.Alarming bouts of volatility in world financial markets over the past 12 months have been rooted in a fear of what happens when a world with its highest-ever peacetime debt pile faces even a hint of higher interest rates.Despite a constant narrative about U.S. households and banks paying down debts ever since the global credit crash eight years ago, any 'deleveraging' that did happen was more than offset by higher government, corporate and personal debt around the globe in Europe, China and across emerging markets.In fact, aggregate world debt is now far higher than it was before the 2007-08 crash.""The saga of debt is far from over,"" says a report from Morgan Stanley. It goes on to explain why Morgan Stanley expects demographic-led shifts in savings and investment to soon push interest rates higher and transform that debt mountain into additional deadweight on world growth over next five years.But the role of the U.S. dollar as the world's main reserve currency denominating large chunks of that debt pile is showing up as complicating factor that's added to risk of instability.The first U.S. interest rate increase in almost a decade in December - just a quarter of a percentage point - was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since World War Two.Underlining 'cause and effect', the subsequent recovery only came about once the Federal Reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance.Few doubt a growing U.S. economy that's near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero, and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that.But the rest of the world clearly can't.The Bank for International Settlements estimates that while U.S. dollar dominance means it accounts for almost 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some 60 percent of hard currency reserves. But crucially it also accounts for about 60 percent of all debts and assets outside the United States.And if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts, the boomerang effect on U.S. exporters, commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the Fed's hands in ways made crystal clear this year already.AMBIVALENCENo surprise, then, the U.S. central bank has no deep love for the dollar's prime reserve currency status - even though it's been described by Europeans and others over the years as an ""exorbitant privilege"" that ensures the world lends to the U.S. Treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength.Speaking at an event in Zurich on Tuesday on the dollar's global status, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley said Americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or China's yuan eventually eat into the dollar's share of reserves.""If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses,"" he said, as long as it ""is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job.""While that's far from wishing away dollar hegemony, it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs - given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy.It's that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere.If the Fed can't adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self-defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar, then there's understandable concern that artificially low Fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that's supposed to play anchor.At the same event in Zurich, Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic Department of the BIS, said the dollar's role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the United States to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits - and to run looser monetary policy for longer.What's more, a resulting Fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons, Borio added.""Easing begets easing,"" he said.For Morgan Stanley, this is just leads to ever-higher debt, and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years - only a series of ""less painful"" options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual.In the meantime, the U.S. bank said, the dollar itself will most likely push higher again, if only because the U.S. economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment.For Borio, a more 'pluralistic' system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn't by itself solve any problem, either. There would then be no credible single anchor.Hard-headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer.""This means not just putting one's house in order, but also putting our global village in order.""",business
"Brent jumped 4 percent on Tuesday while US crude settled up more than 2 percent, after a late burst of buying driven in part by expectations that record US crude inventories would not swell by as much as they have in recent weeks.Crude supply outages in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere also boosted prices. Brent's gain was its biggest one-day percentage move in a month.The market pared gains briefly in post-settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, said U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.45 million barrels to record highs of 543.1 million during the week ended May 6.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a build of only 714,000-barrels.Traders and investors will be looking out for official inventory data on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""We should roll back a good part of today's gains if the EIA confirms the builds cited by API or comes up with even larger numbers,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.Brent LCOc1 settled up $1.89, or 4.3 percent, at $45.52 per barrel.

"Internal differences are killing OPEC and its ability to influence the markets has all but evaporated, top Russian oil executive Igor Sechin told Reuters in some of his harshest remarks ever about the oil cartel.Russia, which has been hit hard by the oil price collapse, was flirting with the idea of cooperating with OPEC in recent months until tensions between OPEC members Saudi Arabia and Iran ruined a global deal to freeze output.Sechin - one of the closest allies of President Vladimir Putin - was the only Russian official to consistently oppose the deal with OPEC even after the Kremlin effectively endorsed the plan.Now that his gloomy predictions about talking to OPEC have come to pass, Sechin feels vindicated and wants to help Russia avoid similar embarrassment in future.""At the moment a number of objective factors exclude the possibility for any cartels to dictate their will to the market. ... As for OPEC, it has practically stopped existing as a united organization.""""The company (Rosneft) was skeptical from the very beginning about the possibility of reaching any sort of joint agreement with OPEC's involvement in current conditions,"" said Sechin, in comments over the weekend which were embargoed until Tuesday.""Just to remind you, the only one question with which we responded to those who were interested to know our position: 'Who should we agree with, and how?' The development of the situation has clearly shown we were right.""Sechin's comments about the end of the era when OPEC could influence prices chime with those of Saudi Arabia's newly appointed energy minister Khaled al-Falih.Falih, who took over on Saturday from long-serving Ali al-Naimi, has been very vocal in the past year about his views that the oil market needs to rebalance through low prices and that the Saudis have the resources to wait.Falih's ultimate boss, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees Saudi oil policies, has also signaled that the world is moving to a new era where supply and demand rather than OPEC will determine prices.Sechin, who was born in 1960 - the same year as Falih - is also calling on Russia to abandon any hope that prices can be fixed by anything other than market rebalancing.""At the moment, key factors which are influencing the market are finance, technology and regulation. We can see this with the example of shale oil which ... became a powerful tool of influence on the global market,"" Sechin said in the emailed comments.",business

"Oil prices fell early on Thursday, weighed by the gradual return of Canadian oil sands production, reversing a sharp rise the previous day when the U.S. government detailed an unexpected fall in crude inventories.International Brent crude futures were trading at $47.13 per barrel at 0143 GMT on Thursday, down 47 cents, or 1 percent, from their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 38 cents or 0.8 percent at $45.85.Traders said the dips were largely a result of profit taking following intra-day Brent price rises of up to $2.95 the previous day.""A lot of people think that yesterday's jump was a bit over the top, so they've taken the profit while they could this morning,"" said one oil trader.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell 3.4 million barrels to 540 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 714,000 barrels and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) reported build of 3.5 million barrels in preliminary data issued on Tuesday.The surprise draw in crude inventories was offset on Thursday by an expected increase in Canadian oil sand crude production following disruptions to over 1 million barrels of daily production capacity due to wildfire.""We were not totally surprised with the draw after the shut-in in Canadian production,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.",business

The comic is slated to be sent to every public library in the United States, and there are more than 150,000 copies printed in eight languages.The theme: why it makes sense to cultivate money smarts.""The challenge was to create a fun, action-packed story while also including a lesson on personal finance,"" said Darren Sanchez, an editor at Marvel. ""Trying to squeeze educational information into a story can be tough, especially with a topic like money management.

Turns out it is Rocket, an intelligent raccoon, who is voiced by Bradley Cooper in the recent big-screen film.When the squad receives a fee for exterminating robopests, Rocket suggests putting some of that money aside for an emergency fund. That cash later comes in handy when the group has to repair their spaceship, and purchase high-tech weapons to vanquish their enemies.

It proved to be so popular with educators that more than half a million copies were eventually printed.This time, in addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy, look for cameos by Ant-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk. It was produced in languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese and Malay.""We wanted simple messages that kids could latch on to and take out of it, like saving for a rainy day,"" said Hugh Norton, Visa's head of financial education. ""Issues like emergency savings are extremely important, and something we can drill into kids from an early age.""On the back of the comic book, kids will find interactive games like word searches, where they can try to locate terms like ""budget,"" ""currency"" and ""goal,"" for example.There is also a wants-versus-needs challenge. Should you spend money on necessities like ""water"" and ""a place to live,"" or luxuries like ""video games"" and ""candy""?

The only subjects they were more reluctant to talk about? Death and sex.And 44 percent have not talked to their kids at all about financial subjects including long-term investing, market volatility, or financial statements.That is where a money-oriented comic book like ""Rocket's Powerful Plan"" could come in handy.

"PANAMA CITY: Panama City's main airport said on Friday it had successfully placed a $575 million bond after a company forming a major source of income for the hub became embroiled in a money-laundering probe, prompting the issue to be restructured.Originally earmarked for $625 million, the bond for Tocumen International Airport was pared back after the U.S. Treasury Department accused members of the Waked family of running a money laundering operation that helped drug traffickers.The Wakeds, who have denied the accusations, control Grupo Wisa, a holding company that includes real estate, construction and media businesses, as well as retailers including operators of duty free shops at Tocumen International.The airport said that last year, rents from Grupo Wisa made up 7.7 percent of its revenue.The coupon on the bond, which is due to mature in 2036, was raised to 5.625 percent from 5.375 percent.The U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) alleged that the operation, led by two members of the Waked family, helped various drug trafficking outfits hide their illicit income via 68 companies including Grupo Wisa.Separately on Friday, the U.S. Treasury said it had issued licenses authorizing certain transactions to be carried out by Balboa Bank &amp; Trust, which was seized by Panama's banking regulator as part of the money-laundering investigation.In the statement, the U.S. Treasury Department said it had also issued licenses to Balboa Securities, Corp.

"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is standing by its procedures for wiring funds after facing scrutiny in the wake of the $81 million cyber heist at the Bangladesh central bank, a letter released by a congresswoman on</<br/>Friday showed.</ The New York Fed was responding to criticism lobbed by U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney, who had called for a probe of the fund transfers triggered by the February cyber attack on Bangladesh Bank.Criminals tried to withdraw $951 million from Bangladesh Banks U.S. bank account in what ranked as one of the largest cyber heists in history.They succeeded in transferring $81 million. In the April 14 letter Thomas Baxter, general counsel and executive vice president at the New York Fed, said the correct procedures were followed in approving five transfers of money on<br/>Feb.4 and in blocking 30.Baxter said the New York Feds procedures for checking transfers included catching those to people subject to sanctions<br/>but would not stop a transfer if it had passed the authentication process on the SWIFT messaging network.""The vast majority of authenticated instructions received from foreign official account holders are not flagged for manual review by the automated systems,"" Baxter wrote in the letter.Authorities in Bangladesh and elsewhere are still trying to figure out how hackers carried out the attack and what happened to the money, which was routed from the Bangladesh Banks account at the New York Fed to accounts in the Philippines.Maloney said in a statement on Friday that while Baxters letter provided key information about the incident, she remained<br/>""concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system.""Maloney said she would urge the New York Fed to review its security protocols to make sure such a heist does not recur.",business
"India has approached Turkey's Halkbank to faciliate the payment of $6.5 billion to Iran, which it owes for crude oil imports, Iran's Fars news agency quoted India's ambassador to Tehran as saying on Saturday.""The Indian government is seeking to pay the $6.5 billion debt and is looking to prepare the banking activities. The receiving bank for this money will be Turkey's Halkbank, and the money will be paid in euros,"" Fars quoted Saurabh Kumar as saying.Halkbank officials were not immediately available for comment.India is one of the biggest customers of Iranian crude, and is set to import at least 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iran in the year from April 1, but built up a backlog of payments when Iran was under sanctions.Since most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in January, India has reached an agreement to send payments to Iran via European banks, India's oil minister told Reuters last week.Although most restrictions on Iran have been lifted, the United States maintains some sanctions and a trade embargo. This means banks cannot use the dollar for any deals with Iran, while U.S. banks are barred from doing business outright.While the U.S. embargo does not in theory prevent non-U.S. banks from dealing with Iran, in reality many remain hesitant to do so because they faced hefty fines in the past and are wary of the U.S. sanctions that remain in place.",business

"DUBLIN: Finance ministers from the world's largest developed economies met in Germany a year ago against a backdrop of faltering global growth, scant inflationary pressures and the latest chapter in the Greek debt crisis.When they and their G7 central bank colleagues convene again in Japan on Friday the first two items remain just as problematic as and potentially even trickier than a year ago. Only unusually smooth talks between Athens and its lenders may keep Greece off the agenda this time around.The hosts' monetary and fiscal policy trajectory appears obvious: the Bank of Japan is coming under increasing pressure to counter a damaging rise in the value of the yen that could derail a fragile recovery for the world's third-largest economy.Talk of more action gathered pace after an academic seen to be close to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ is likely to expand monetary stimulus either in June or July. The government has also said Tokyo is ready to intervene in currency markets.Whether explicitly on the agenda or not, such interventions are certain to be brought up by counterparts from France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Canada and the United States either side of a planned field trip to see how the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai has recovered from the devastating 2011 earthquake.On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe beat the drum for a broader fiscal stimulus, saying most G7 leaders agreed it was necessary as a means of boosting global demand, though getting all of them to enact the same policy steps would be tough.First-quarter Japanese economic output data on Wednesday - following on from more signs of slowing growth in China - should flesh out the downbeat picture with quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to have expanded just 0.1 percent, according to a Reuters poll.""The Bank of Japan has been heavily criticized for its decision not to take further economic stimulus measures at its meeting in April,"" said Commerzbank economist Bernd Weidensteiner.""Because of its refusal to bow to the market expectations of 'more and more', the central bank currently faces a tough task to convince the markets of its policy actions.""FED PUZZLEThings are not so straightforward for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is caught in a bind over when to push interest rates higher amid concerns about the health of the labor market at home and fears about the knock-on effects its actions will have abroad.There was fresh hesitation among economists ahead of the release in the coming week of the minutes from the April 26/27 Fed meeting when the central bank's rate-setting committee acknowledged that economic growth seemed to have slowed.The Fed will likely wait until September before raising rates again, a Reuters poll found this week, stretching to nine months the time since its first hike in nearly a decade as it waits for clear signs inflation is picking up.April's U.S. inflation figures arrive on Tuesday, a day before the euro zone give an update on its battle to register any kind of price growth and the same day Britain releases its consumer price data for last month.British price growth is expected to have slowed after a pick up in March while jobless numbers on Wednesday may also show a dip in hiring in the first quarter as employers turn cautious ahead of June's Brexit vote. Retail sales are due on Thursday.Latest polling on the EU membership referendum will be just as closely watched to see if the Bank of England's warning that Brexit would slow the economy sharply, and could even push it into recession, has had any impact on voters.""Signs of a slowing economy and uncertainty around Britain's EU referendum appear to have resulted in a shift in emphasis from permanent to temporary hiring among UK employers,"" Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said. ""The labor market may therefore be set to cool further in coming months.""The other big Q1 GDP releases come from Russia and Mexico while interest rate decisions include South Africa.",business
"Oil prices edged up in early trading on Monday as output falls in Nigeria and worries about political instability in Venezuela tightened the market, although rising OPEC output and a stronger dollar capped gains.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at $48.11 per barrel at 0148 GMT, up 28 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were up 25 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $46.46 a barrel.Analysts said that falling supplies from producers such as Nigeria, the Americas and China had pushed up prices, although they added that increases elsewhere were capping gains.""Oil struggled to hold gains from the previous day as the return of output from Canadian producers negated (production)losses,"" said ANZ bank.In Nigeria, oil major Exxon Mobil suspended exports from the country's biggest crude stream, Qua Iboe, and other producers like Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have also suffered disruptions following acts of sabotage, cutting output to its lowest in decades of around 1.65 million barrels per day.In the Americas, major oil exporter Venezuela seemed to be on the brink of political and economic meltdown, triggering fears of default by its national oil company PDVSA, which has to make almost $5 billion in bond payments this year.Venezuela's oil production has already fallen by at least 188,000 bpd since the start of the year as PDVSA struggles to make the necessary investment to keep output steady.Adding to these disruptions were the United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has fallen to 8.8 million bpd, 8.4 percent below 2015 peaks as the sector suffers a wave of debt-fuelled bankruptcies.In China, Asia's biggest oil producer and consumer, output fell 5.6 percent to 4.04 million bpd in April, compared with the same time last year.Yet countering these disruptions was rising supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) following the lifting of sanctions against Iran which triggered a race for market share between Tehran and OPEC-rivals like Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.OPEC pumped 32.44 million bpd in April, up 188,000 bpd from March. This is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports.Also weighing on markets was recovering output in Canada following forced closures due to a wildfire, as well as a 3 percent rise in the dollar this month against other leading currencies.

"Crude oil futures held near six-month highs in early Asian trading as the market focused on supply disruptions that prompted long-time bear Goldman Sachs to issue a bullish assessment on near-term prices.Crude futures have rallied for most of the past two weeks from a combination of Nigerian, Venezuelan and other outages, declining U.S. production and virtually frozen inflows of Canadian crude after wildfires in Alberta's oil sands region.U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 8 cents at $47.80 a barrel at 0047 GMT. They rose by $1.51, or 3.3 percent, to end at $47.72 after touching a six-month high on Monday.Brent crude futures were down 5 cents at $48.92 a barrel after rising slightly following the opening of trade.

"As noon-time temperatures began soaring in late March, Mohamed Nizam, a small-scale chicken seller, knew he was headed for trouble.Soon the mid-day heat was touching 40 degrees Celsius, and Nizam told his workers to pour water on to the pavement in front of his shop in the Colombo suburb of Wattala in an effort to ward off the heat.""But nothing can keep that kind of heat from getting to the chickens. It roasts them alive,"" Nizam said.Across Sri Lanka, small- and medium-scale chicken producers  often with between 1,000 and 25,000 birds  are struggling to keep their birds alive in the face of temperatures 2 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius above normal over the last two months.Many of the birds live in tightly packed pens, where the heat makes them dehydrated. Larger industrial operations use fans and spray water on them, but smaller operations cannot afford such investments.Usually when the heat is high, we use ice or water to keep the pens cool. This time they were no match for the heat. I lost half of my stock, said Rumi Jamaldean, who runs a farm with around 8,000 birds in the Kurunegala District, about 120 kilometres from Colombo.RISING PRICESThe losses have translated into big hikes in chicken prices. In Colombo and its suburbs a kilo of fresh chicken was selling for 620 rupees (around $5.50) during the first week of May. Two months earlier it was Rs 450 and a year ago Rs 400.My sales have dropped, Nizam said, estimating they had fallen by 40 percent. People cant afford it. The prices are way too much, he said.With chicken by far the most popular meat in this largely Buddhist nation that shuns many other types of meat, the price hike is likely to have an impact on nutrition. On average a Sri Lankan eats seven times as much chicken per year as beef, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.The nations poultry industry produces about 165,000 metric tons of meat a year, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.Sri Lankan chicken farmers have long experience with warm months and often use homegrown methods to keep their birds cool, including ice, water, fans or sometimes feeding the birds sodium-bicarbonate, which growers say can help prevent dehydration.But this time the heat was too much and nothing could have prevented such losses, said Nimal Jayaratne, head of the Department of Animal Production and Health.According to the Meteorological Department, during the fourth week of April the Northern Vavuniya District recorded an average daily temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. During the same time period, rain fall was below average.It has been extremely warm, warmer than any other time in the past five years, said Lal Chandrapala, director general of the Meteorological Department.Experts and farmers agree that Sri Lankas small-scale chicken farmers are not ready to deal with such extreme heat.If you look at the pens, they are just brick sheds with corrugated tin sheets on the roof. During times when the weather is okay, they can work. But when the heat comes, there is hardly any room for ventilation and there is no money to invest to save the stock, Jayaratne said.Chicken farmer Jamaldean said he will absorb the losses as much as he can, pass some portion of it to his customers, and just wait until the heat passes, with cooler monsoon weather due late this month or in early June.But chicken prices will not come down soon. It will take at least two months, warned Nizam.",business

"The International Monetary Fund backed Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform plan on Thursday and said the kingdom was cutting spending at the right speed to cope with a huge state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.Late last month, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced steps to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil exports over the next 15 years, including subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment.The IMF had for years been urging Saudi Arabia to adopt many of those measures, and in a statement on Thursday it said the reform plan aimed for ""an appropriately bold and far-reaching transformation of the Saudi Arabian economy"".""The supporting policies that will be announced in the coming months are expected to set out how these goals will be achieved,"" IMF official Tim Callen said after leading a team to Saudi Arabia this month for annual consultations with the Fund.""To ensure their success, the reforms will need to be properly prioritized and sequenced, and the appropriate pace of implementation carefully assessed.""Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totaled $98 billion in 2015. The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.But it welcomed the government's spending controls and changes to domestic energy prices announced last December, saying: ""Fiscal policy is appropriately adjusting to the drop in oil prices."" The economy is expected to grow 1.2 percent this year, slowing from 3.5 percent in 2015, the Fund said.DEFICIT FINANCINGThe IMF also said it approved of the way in which the government was financing its deficit with a combination of drawing down its financial reserves and issuing debt at home and abroad.The Fund has been encouraging some North African states to make their foreign exchange rates more flexible to cope with big current account deficits. But it took the opposite tack toward the external deficit which Saudi Arabia is running because of cheap oil, saying the riyal's peg to the U.S. dollar was continuing to serve the economy well.Market interest rates in Saudi Arabia have been rising sharply as the government borrows from banks to finance its deficit, with the three-month Saudi interbank offered rate SASAR3MD= jumping 135 basis points since mid-2015 to a multi-year high of 2.13 percent.But the IMF said the Saudi banking sector was strong and well-positioned to weather a slowing economy, and that tightening liquidity was not yet hurting credit growth.Two cornerstones of the Saudi reform plan are the sale of a stake of up to 5 percent in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, which could fetch tens of billions of dollars, and a build-up of the government's Public Investment Fund into a global investment vehicle.The IMF urged Riyadh to make both institutions more transparent and to integrate them into a new fiscal policy apparatus which the government is creating to make spending decisions more efficient.",business
"Prices of many foodstuffs such as pulses, sugar, vegetables and poultry products are set to surge in India in the next three months on thin supplies, which could fuel inflation and give the central bank little room to cut rates, said analysts.April consumer price inflation broke a recent slowing trend after food inflation came in at 6.32 percent, compared with 5.21 percent in March.

Potato prices have doubled.Prices are likely to rise further as demand grows in coming months due to festivals like Ramadan, said Ashwini Bansod, a senior analyst at Phillip Commodities India Pvt Ltd.Rising prices could make it difficult for Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to again cut interest rates.A fall in inflation to within targeted levels earlier this year allowed Rajan in April to cut rates to a more than five-year low.""With core inflation also sticky, headline inflation is therefore likely to stay at 5 percent or higher which makes it difficult for further rate cuts by the RBI,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.Despite higher prices, farmers have been unable to cultivate vegetables due to higher temperatures and water scarcity.Water levels in the country's 91 major reservoirs have depleted to 19 percent of capacity as of May 12, compared to 31 percent a year ago.Many state governments like the western state of Maharashtra have cut water supplies for agriculture and reserved it for drinking purpose.""Every year in summer I cultivate vegetables.

But the Nikkei later pared its gains to just 0.2 percent.The Fed minutes noted Fed officials said it would be appropriate to raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment.Such views helped revive the prospect of a rate hike in June, which had been dismissed by many investors.CME fed fund futures showed that the probability of a June rate increase by the Fed rose to 34 percent after the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday from 19 percent earlier in the day, 15 percent on Tuesday, and less than 1.0 percent a month ago, according to CME group's FedWatch.Still, many in the market are still skeptical the Fed would raise rates ahead of Britain's June 23 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union, a risk that was pointed out by some Fed policymakers.

The euro was pinned down near $1.1214, its lowest since late March.""With April activity indicators consistent with a healthy bounce-back in growth, we see risks of two rate hikes in 2016, with the first coming in the June/July time horizon,"" strategists at Barclays said.Fed Vice Chairs William Dudley and Stanley Fischer are due to speak later in the day and the markets will be eager to get more details on the Fed's thinking.Gold took the renewed expectations of a U.S. rate hike on the chin. Prices for the precious metal are inversely correlated to monetary policy easing, fell 0.1 percent to a three-week low $1256 per ounce.The stronger dollar also weighed on commodities such as oil, which saw U.S. crude futures CLc1 lose 0.4 percent to $48.00 a barrel. A stronger dollar tends to put non-U.S. buyers of greenback-denominated commodities at a disadvantage.Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 fell to as low as $4563.50 overnight, the weakest since Feb. 19 and was hovering near those levels.",business
"When Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this weekend as part of an Asian tour aimed at boosting sales, he will sit down with a man whose penchant for a selfie - often using his gold iPhone - can get him into trouble.Modi breached electoral rules when he photographed himself holding his party's symbol of a lotus flower immediately after casting his vote in the 2014 general election, one of the many selfies he regularly takes with his Apple phone.Cook meets the 65-year old prime minister in New Delhi on Saturday, and will be hoping Modi's enthusiasm for phones can help Apple as it tries to bolster sales in India.While smartphone usage is surging as the middle class swells, most Indians still can't afford Apple's iPhones and the company has only about 2 percent market share in a country where 100 million phones were sold last year.Apart from snapping the usual selfie, Modi is likely to tell Cook that if Apple wants to sell more phones in India, it should make them there, and help the prime minister realize his ambition of turning the country into a manufacturing powerhouse.Cook will also have to remember not to come between Modi and his love of the limelight: on a trip to Silicon Valley in September Modi appeared to shove Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg aside so that the cameras could capture him fully.Cook and Modi's meeting will cap an unusually long trip to India that has seen the Apple boss pray at an elephant-god temple in Mumbai, watch cricket and dine with Bollywood stars.",business

"India will on Monday sign a commercial contract with Iran to build and run a strategic port on Iran's southern coast, the Indian government said on Friday, to help it gain a foothold in Iran and win access to central Asia and Afghanistan.Talks to build the Chabahar port have been on for years but since the scaling back of Western sanctions against Iran, India has pushed hard for the project so it doesn't lose out to other such as China, who are keen to invest.The deal under which India will develop two terminals and cargo berths at Chabahar, on the Gulf of Oman, will be signed during a visit by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Iran beginning on Sunday.Gopal Baglay, a foreign ministry official in charge of Iranian ties, said India would make an initial investment of more than $200 million in the port, of which India's Exim Bank would provide a credit line of $150 million.""The focus of the trip is connectivity and infrastructure,"" he told reporters.India is blocked from land access to Afghanistan and through it to the central Asia countries because of opposition from Pakistan, which sees India's expansive diplomacy in the region as a threat.Baglay said India, Afghanistan and Iran would separately sign an agreement to set up a trade and transport corridor during Modi's trip that will have Chabahar as the hub.Road and rail links are to be built so that landlocked Afghanistan can get access to the Iranian port as an alternate to the Pakistani port of Karachi.""The trilateral agreement will be a game changer for regional connectivity especially for Afghanistan which can find an assured and reliable alternate access to India via sea,"" Baglay said.Chabahar is about 100 km (60 miles) from Pakistan's Gwadar seaport which China is developing as part of a $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.The Chinese project, coming on top of investments in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and the Maldives raised disquiet in India about China's expanding reach in the region and prompted faster movement on the Iranian project.""A major flaw in India's current policy towards Iran has been the lack of implementation of signed agreements,"" said Meena Singh Roy, an expert on India's ties with Iran at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses.",business
"SENDAI, JAPAN: A rift on fiscal policy and currencies is likely to set the stage for G7 advanced economies to agree on a ""go-your-own-way"" response to address risks hindering global economic growth at their finance leaders' gathering on Friday.As years of aggressive money printing stretch the limits of monetary policy, the G7 policy response to anemic inflation and subdued growth has become increasingly splintered.Finance leaders gathering in Sendai, northeast Japan, sought advice from prominent academics, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Shiller, on ways to boost growth in an informal symposium ahead of an official G7 meeting on Friday.Participants of the symposium agreed that instead of relying on short-term fiscal stimulus or monetary policy, structural reforms combined with appropriate investment are solutions to achieving sustainable growth, a G7 source said.If so, that would dash Japan's hopes to garner an agreement on the need for coordinated fiscal action to spur global demand.Germany showed no signs of responding to calls from Japan and the United States to boost fiscal stimulus, instead warning of the dangers of excessive monetary loosening.""There is high nervousness in financial markets"" fostered by huge government debt and excess liquidity around the globe, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Thursday.But G7 officials have signaled that they would not object if Japan were to call for stronger action using monetary, fiscal tools and structural reforms - catered to each country's individual needs.That means the G7 finance leaders, while fretting about risks to outlook, may be unable to agree on concrete steps to bolster stagnant global growth.""I expect there to be a frank exchange of views on how to achieve price stability and growth using monetary, fiscal and structural policies reflecting each country's needs,"" Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters on Thursday.BREXIT HIGH ON AGENDAThe risk of a British vote to exit the European Union in a June referendum, or Brexit, will be high on the agenda at Friday's G7 session on the global economy.""A Brexit could, in the short-term, lead to turbulence in financial markets,"" the G7 source said.In second-day talks on Saturday, the G7 finance leaders will discuss, among other topics, the need to boost cyber-security.While policymakers have long spoken about the need to enhance cyber-security as financial transactions become increasingly global, there is a growing awareness among G7 leaders that they need to take prompt action, sources familiar with the group's discussions say.A cyber theft that hit a Bangladesh central bank account in February has led SWIFT, the global financial network that banks use to transfer billions of dollars every day, to warn that it was aware of a number of cyber incidents where attackers had sent fraudulent messages over its system.",business
"Oil prices rose in early trading on Friday as turmoil in Nigeria, shale bankruptcies in the United States and crisis in Venezuela all contributed to tightening supplies.Despite this, brimming inventories across the world were preventing supply shortfalls and sharper price spikes, traders said.International Brent crude futures LCOc1 were trading at $49.10 per barrel at 0128 GMT, up 29 cents or 0.59 percent from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 was up 39 cents, or 0.81 percent, at $48.55 a barrel.ANZ bank said that unexpected supply disruptions across the world, excluding output falls in the United States, amounted to around 2.5 million barrels of daily production, virtually erasing a production overhang that had pulled down prices by over 70 percent between 2014 and early 2016.""The supply disruptions inflicting the oil market continue to ratchet up... As these issues linger, we expect an increasing supply risk premium will price into the market,"" the bank said.Nigeria's oil production showed further signs of strain on Thursday as intruders blocked access to Exxon Mobil's terminal exporting Qua Iboe, the country's largest crude stream.Libyan output has also been hit by internal conflict.Militant activity in the oil-rich Niger Delta has taken out some 500,000 barrels per day of crude oil production from other companies in Nigeria, pushing oil output in Africa's largest-producing nation to more than 22-year lows.In North America, U.S. crude oil output has fallen 8.79 million barrels per day (bpd), down from a peak of more than 9.6 million bpd last year, as a wave of bankruptcies hits producers.In Canada, production has also been cut as wildfires forced closures of around 1 million barrels in daily production, although output is gradually returning.In South America, output from OPEC-member Venezuela is also stalling as its state-owned oil company PDVSA struggles with a cash squeeze amid a deep political and economic crisis.Venezuelan crude oil output fell to around 2.53 million bpd in the first quarter of 2016 compared with 2.72 million bpd in the same quarter of last year, data from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) showed.Despite the disruptions oil supplies to customers are not at risk, thanks to ongoing high output in the Middle East and Russia, and because of brimming oil inventories across the world, including the United States and Asia.",business
"NEW DELHI/Apple Inc chief Tim Cook met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday, concluding a four-day trip to India that could set the stage for Apples expansion plans in one of the worlds fastest growing smartphone markets.Modi and Cook met for an hour in central Delhi and discussed Apples plans for its India business, including the possibility of manufacturing and retailing in the country.Apple is looking to expand its retail presence in India and is pursuing a license to set up its own stores, which could start to open as early as next year.Government officials say India is keen to get Apple to start making products in the country in what would be a boost for Modis ""Make in India"" manufacturing push.""Every aspect of business was discussed. Now its for Apple to talk about their plans,"" a close aide of Modi said.Cooks first official visit to the country comes at a crucial time as Apple looks for new growth markets after posting its first-ever decline in iPhone sales.More than 100 million smartphones were sold in India last year and sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year, but Apple only has about a 2 percent share of the market.The company has been pushing the Indian government to allow it to import refurbished phones in the country, but that application was turned down earlier this month.A second source aware of the meeting said Cook asked Modi to reconsider the companys plans to import refurbished phones  a strategy seen key for Apple to make affordable iPhones available in a country where most smartphone sell for less than $150.In an interview with NDTV channel on Friday, Cook said Apple plans to import second hand phones and refurbish them at a facility in India.Cook spent most of the week meeting heads of Indias largest companies, including telecom operator Bharti Airtel and lender ICICI Bank, but also took out time to visit a temple, dine with Bollywood stars and watch cricket.Apple also announced plans to expand a software development centre it recently opened in Hyderebad and launched a program for local developers working on its iOS platform.Modi and Cook also discussed cyber-security and data encryption, a government statement said.Apple has been at the centre of a debate on the role technology companies play in protecting data that led to a much-publicised dispute between Apple and the FBI over a phone linked to a shooting in San Bernardino, California.",business

"Indian refiners have cleared part of the $6.4 billion owed to Iran for crude oil imports in euros through Turkey's Halkbank, three sources privy to the payment said on Saturday.This is the first payment to Iran by India since the lifting of Western sanctions against the Persian Gulf nation earlier this year and comes just ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit beginning on Sunday.State refiner Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd paid $500 million while Indian Oil Corp has settled $250 million through the Union Bank of India, the sources said.The refiners had been holding back 55 percent of the oil payments to Iran after the route to make payments through Halkbank was stopped in 2013, although payment of some of those funds was allowed after an initial temporary deal to lift the sanctions.It is not yet known when the second instalment will be paid, the sources said.India is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian crude, and is set to import at least 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Iran in the year from April 1.

"Japans extraordinarily easy monetary policy, a source of friction with the United States for pushing the yens value down, has had some positive effects on emerging Asian economies, including increased growth and equity prices, International Monetary Fund researchers have found.The IMF findings were released in a paper on Friday, as Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in Japan, where divergent views on Japans monetary policy and currency market interventions were expected to be a hot topic.The paper claims to be the first to model the spillover effects of Japans qualitative and quantitative easing program (QQE) on Southeast Asian countries.QQE was launched in 2013 and targets both government bond purchases as well as other assets, such as exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.The program has helped push down the yen from 82 to the dollar in 2012 to 119 to the dollar by August 2015. Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said. ""Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan, when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices, consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries, as well as an appreciation of their currencies,"" they wrote.""Most (Southeast Asian) countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation. Capital inflows surged in many countries.""They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japans QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a ""generally positive"" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in<br/> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.",business
"ABU DHABI: Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulfs wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies.Since mid-2015, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries in the region have curbed spending on some construction projects and reduced energy subsidies to limit budget deficits caused by cheap oil.Now some governments are also starting to reduce staff at the companies they control, many of them in the energy industry, in order to ensure the firms are not a drain on state finances if oil prices stay low for several years.Abu Dhabis National Oil Co (ADNOC), with around 55,000 staff, has cut hundreds of jobs in the last few months and will have reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 by the end of 2016, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The reduction will occur across most of its 17 subsidiaries as part of a restructuring following a reshuffle of the firms leadership this month, they said.An ADNOC spokesman did not confirm or deny the cuts but said: ""In keeping with the entire oil and gas industry, ADNOC is constantly looking at ways to be more efficient and more profitable, particularly in the current market environment.""The UAEs oil and gas recruitment market is set for its most difficult year in over a decade in 2016, a report from recruiters Morgan McKinley said.""The oil and gas industry is still feeling the pain, as was to be expected. Overall redundancies have been on the increase,"" said Trefor Murphy, managing director for the region.Most layoffs at Abu Dhabi state firms are not in response to production cut-backs; the UAE has not reduced its oil output, and says it is proceeding with long-planned oil and gas development projects.Nor do the layoffs mean Abu Dhabi is running out of money.With hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund, the emirate could draw down its reserves to sustain current levels of spending for decades.But the government wants to minimise the speed of the draw-down as it looks ahead to the possibility of many years of low oil prices.Last year, Abu Dhabi acted ahead of other Gulf States in cutting domestic fuel and electricity subsidies.Now it is applying the same approach to state-linked firms.In Qatar, state-controlled firms such as Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Rail have been laying off staff.State companies in other states such as Saudi Arabia and Oman have been looking at ways to reduce costs but have so far not resorted to major job cuts.CUTSMost cuts at state firms in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere involve foreign staff rather than locals, because governments want to limit unemployment among their citizens.Nevertheless, the job losses are contributing to an economic slowdown in the region.The International Monetary Fund has predicted Abu Dhabis gross domestic product growth will fall to 1.7 percent this year from 4.4 percent in 2015.In neighbouring Dubai, where the economy is not directly reliant on oil and state-linked firms are vigorously pushing tourism and real estate projects, growth is forecast to accelerate marginally, to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent.Companies cutting staff in Abu Dhabi include Abu Dhabi National Energy Co, which has reduced its workforce by a quarter since 2014. It has cut around a third of oil and gas jobs and 55 percent of staff at its headquarters, it said this month after reporting a first-quarter loss.Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Rail, the federal government-owned entity building a UAE rail network, said it cut 30 percent of its staff in a restructuring.Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority laid off scores of people, mostly expatriates, sources said.Spokespeople for the authority did not return calls seeking comment.National Petroleum Construction Co, owned by Abu Dhabis state-owned industrial conglomerate Senaat and one of the largest oilfield contractors in Abu Dhabi, is reviewing its manpower levels, chief executive Aqeel Madhi told Reuters.Construction firm Arabtec, in which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments is the biggest shareholder, may include job cuts in its cost reduction programme, chairman Mohamed al-Rumaithi said last month, adding: ""Theres some fat to be taken out.""Some firms are axing expatriates to create jobs for UAE nationals.Medical centre operator Cleveland Clinic, owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, is creating over 100 positions for locals, having told some expatriate staff they have to leave by year-end, sources said.Asked to comment, Cleveland said that as part of its efforts to develop local talent, a number of administrative roles would move to UAE citizens in coming months.",business
"British Prime Minister David Cameron warned voters on Sunday that they would face higher grocery bills if the country decides to leave the European Union at a June 23 referendum, citing a potential drop in the value of sterling.Cameron is leading the push to keep Britain inside the European Union ahead of the referendum, the outcome of which will have far-reaching consequences for the country's economy, its role in world trade and its global diplomatic status.His comments mark a shift in campaign tactics by the 'In' side: a push to make explicit the direct link between the macroeconomic risks that have dominated the Brexit debate so far, and their potential impact on Britons' day to day lives.""A weaker currency means more expensive imports; that means more expensive food and it drives higher business costs. And we all know where that ends up: higher prices in the shops,"" Cameron wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper.The warning comes from a government analysis of the short-term impact that a British exit would have on voters.He said the average family's weekly food and drink bill would rise by almost 3 percent, or 120 pounds ($174.06) per year, and that clothing and footwear costs would rise by 5 percent, or 100 pounds per year.The 'rival 'Out' campaign disputed the analysis. ""The EU pushes up the prices in our supermarkets because of its protectionist policies. That's ok for big business fat cats but it's not good for British families,' said Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott.Six out of the last seven polls published in the last week have shown the Remain campaign in the lead, and on Saturday two major bookmakers offered the shortest odds to date on a vote to remain.On Friday Osborne warned, citing the same Treasury analysis, said house prices would fall if Britain left the EU.

"Indian farmers are set to reduce the area given over to soybeans by up to 10 percent this year in response to falling prices, pushing up likely imports of edible oils such as palm oil and soyoil.Soybean is the main summer-sown oilseed crop for the world's biggest importer of edible oil, but prices have dropped 10 percent in the past two years, while the prices of pulses such as red gram have nearly tripled over the same period.Lower soybean output will force the country to increase imports of edible oils, supporting their prices. It could also limit India's soymeal exports, given prices for its GMO-free produce are already above international prices.The further price rise due to lower supply could even make imports of soymeal viable for local consumers.""In the last two-three years soybeans have given lower returns than competing crops like pulses,"" said K N Rahiman, chief research officer at Ruchi Soya, the country's biggest edible oil refiner.""This year, since pulses prices are ruling near record high levels, farmers will be inclined to shift towards pulses.

A 10 percent reduction would cut acreage to around 10.5 million hectares in the 2016/17 marketing year starting July.Most Indian farmers begin cultivating soybean and pulses, which are rain-fed crops, in June after the arrival of the monsoon rains, and they are sown mainly in the states of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Maharashtra in the west, Rajasthan in the north-west, and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the south.Dinesh Garg, a farmer from Morena in Madhya Pradesh, plants soybean during summer, but this year he has decided instead to cultivate red gram, better known locally as tuar.""Soybean is not remunerative due to lower prices. This year I am more interested in growing tuar,"" said Garg, who cultivated soybean on 5 hectares of land last year.Soybean production plunged 20 percent in 2015/16 to its lowest in more than a decade after drought and pests hit output.India exports soymeal mainly to Asian buyers, but the drop in production has forced it to import soymeal and soybean in small quantities for the first time in many years.Since the country imports most of its edible oil, limited soybean supply means imports will go up in 2016/17, said Faiyaz Hudani, associate vice-president, research, at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd.""Even though oilseed production is stagnant, edible oil consumption has been rising steadily due to growth in population and rising prosperity,"" Hudani said.India imports mainly palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, while it brings in soyoil from Argentina and Brazil.",business
"Oil prices were little changed in thin early Asian trade on Tuesday as a firmer dollar weighed on oil markets while a likely drawdown in US crude and gasoline stockpiles pointed to stronger demand ahead of the US summer driving season.US crude futures edged down 4 cents to $48.04 a barrel by 8.16 p.m. ET, having settled down 33 cents in the previous session.Brent futures dipped 4 cents to $48.31 after closing down 37 cents in the previous session, with both contracts finishing with modest losses for a fourth straight sessionUS commercial crude oil stocks likely fell by around 2.5 million barrels to 538.8 million in the week ended May 20, a preliminary Reuters analysts' poll taken ahead of weekly industry and official inventory data showed on Monday.Gasoline stocks likely fell 1.3 million barrels last week, while distillate inventories, which include heating oil and diesel fuel, likely decreased by a million barrels, the poll showed.The American Petroleum Institute (API) is due to release its inventory data later on Tuesday, while the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due on Wednesday.The dollar index rose marginally higher against a basket of currencies on Tuesday, as investors continued to factor in an increased chance of a near-term U.S. interest rate rise.A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies.Still, US data economic overnight was disappointing, with the preliminary Markit manufacturing PMI in May falling to 50.5, the lowest level this year.""Markit PMI data continued to point to a difficult period for manufacturing as Q2 unfolds,"" ANZ said in a market report on Tuesday.Crude exports from Iraq's southern oil fields have fallen by more than 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to around 3.15 million barrels so far in May, according to an industry source and loading data.

"LONDON/OPEC's thorniest dilemma of the past year - at least from a purely oil standpoint - is about to disappear.Less than six months after the lifting of Western sanctions, Iran is close to regaining normal oil export volumes, adding extra barrels to the market in an unexpectedly smooth way and helped by supply disruptions from Canada to Nigeria.But the development will do little to repair dialogue, let alone help clinch a production deal, when OPEC meets next week amid rising political tensions between arch-rivals Iran and oil superpower Saudi Arabia, OPEC sources and delegates say.Earlier this year, Tehran refused to join an initiative to boost prices by freezing output but signaled it would be part of a future effort once its production had recovered sufficiently. OPEC has no supply limit, having at its last meeting in December scrapped its production target.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) figures, Iran's output has reached levels seen before the imposition of sanctions over its nuclear program. Tehran says it is not yet there.But while Iran may be more willing now to talk, an increase in oil prices has reduced the urgency of propping up the market, OPEC delegates say. Oil has risen toward a more producer-friendly $50 from a 12-year low near $27 in January.""I don't think OPEC will decide anything,"" a delegate from a major Middle East producer said. ""The market is recovering because of supply disruptions and demand recovery.""A senior OPEC delegate, asked whether the group would make any changes to output policy at its June 2 meeting, said: Nothing. The freeze is finished.Within OPEC, Iran has long pushed for measures to support oil prices. That position puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia, the driving force behind OPEC's landmark November 2014 refusal to cut supply in order to boost the market.Sources familiar with Iranian oil policy see no sign of any change of approach by Riyadh under new Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih - who is seen as a believer in reform and low oil prices.""It really depends on those countries within OPEC with a high level of production,"" one such source said. ""It does not seem that Saudi Arabia will be ready to cooperate with other members.""HIGHER EXPORTSIran has managed to increase oil exports significantly in 2016 after the lifting of sanctions in January.It notched up output of 3.56 million barrels of oil per day in April, the IEA said, a level last reached in November 2011 before sanctions were tightened.Saudi Arabia produced a near-record-high 10.26 million barrels per day in April and has kept output relatively steady over the past year, its submissions to OPEC show.Iran, according to delegates from other OPEC members, is unlikely to restrain supplies, given that it believes Saudi Arabia should cut back itself to make room for Iranian oil.""Iran won't support any freeze or cut,"" said a non-Iranian OPEC delegate. ""But Iran may put pressure on Saudi Arabia that they hold the responsibility.""Saudi thinking, however, has moved on from the days when Riyadh cut or increased output unilaterally. Talks in Doha on the proposed output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers fell through after Saudi insisted that Iran participate.Indeed, differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which helped found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 56 years ago, over OPEC policy have made cooperation harder - to say nothing of more fundamental disagreements.For more than a decade after oil crashed to $10 in 1997, the two set aside rivalries to manage the market and support prices, although they fell into opposing OPEC camps with Iran wanting high prices and Saudi more moderate.Now, the Sunni-Shia conflicts setting Saudi Arabia and Iran at each other's throats, particularly in Syria and Yemen, make the relationship between the two even more fraught.The two disagree over OPEC's future direction. Earlier in May, OPEC failed to decide on a long-term strategy as Saudi Arabia objected to Iran's proposal that the exporter group aim for ""effective production management"".With that backdrop, ministers may be advised to keep expectations low, an OPEC watcher said.""The only aspiration OPEC should have for its 2 June meeting is simply not to repeat the chaos of the Doha process,"" said Paul Horsnell, analyst at Standard Chartered.""A straightforward meeting with no binding commitments and, most importantly, no overt arguments would be the best outcome for ministers.""",business
"Gold dropped to a seven-week low on Wednesday, driven by expectations of an early interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Bullion has taken a beating from the prospect of an imminent rate increase, as indicated by Fed meeting minutes released last week. Gold is sensitive to interest rates, gains in which raise the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-yielding asset.Spot gold was up 0.1 percent at $1,227.90 per ounce by 0317 GMT.

The change in rate hike expectations is still the major theme, but after the end of June the overall sentiment on the rate hike will be pretty much done,"" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.Adding to the woes of the safe-haven bullion, the dollar stood near a two-month peak against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after robust U.S. housing data supported the case for the Fed to raise rates in the near term.A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.The growing confidence towards a pick-up in U.S. economic growth got a boost on Tuesday as official data suggested new U.S. single-family home sales have hit the highest in eight years.The recent negative undertone for gold notwithstanding, some analysts believe a rate increase as early as June seems unlikely and would be discounted by traders, stabilising the yellow metal.""Despite the short term negative pullback, gold is still a strong 2016 performer against a range of alternative assets and these levels are an enticing entry price for long term bulls,"" MKS Group trader James Gardiner said.Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.44 percent to 868.66 tonnes on Tuesday, the first decline in a month.Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.3 percent, to $16.25 an ounce.

"Oil rose about 1 percent on Tuesday on a boost from Wall Street and expectations of a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories, then prices jumped another 1 percent after settlement to nearly $50 (34.2) a barrel after an industry group suggested the draw was larger than expected.Data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) showed U.S. crude inventories fell 5.1 million barrels last week, double the expectations of analysts polled by Reuters.The market will watch for confirmation of the big draw when the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) issues official inventory numbers on Wednesday.The rally in crude prices could push prices beyond the $50 long targeted by market bulls.""The crude numbers are certainly bullish to an extent, reflecting the supplies lost from the Canadian wildfires,"" said John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge Again Capital. ""We could certainly test $50 anytime now, even close above that, if the EIA data turns out to be as supportive.""The API also reported higher gasoline inventories which could pressure prices, but traders said the market would probably focus more on the crude drawdown.U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 settled up 54 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $48.62 a barrel.

Crude buyers also seemed unfazed by a stronger dollar, which typically makes greenback-denominated oil costlier in other currencies.Earlier in the session, oil was supported by the drop in Iraqi oil output to 4.5 million barrels per day from January's record high of 4.78 million bpd.Consultant IHS said just 2.8 billion barrels of oil were discovered outside North America in 2015 following a sharp fall in exploration and appraisal drilling.

"The advent of mobile and smartphone technology has transformed the dynamics of communication in Pakistan. The adoption rates for smartphones are growing rapidly in both urban and rural centers. In 2015, 31% of mobiles purchased in the country were smartphones. Pakistan has approximately 80% mobile user penetration. These mobile phones have become so common that they are not considered a luxury device anymore but rather, an item of necessity. This technology has the potential to solve various day-to-day problems and the ability to lift people out of poverty. In fact, in the life of every individual, a mobile phone plays a critical role.The reason behind a common man owning a phone can be attributed to price affordability and availability of quality smartphones within the reach of the masses. There are some big names is Pakistans smartphone market, but the role which Q Mobile has played for equipping the masses with mobile and smartphones has to be applauded. Q Mobile, which is the largest smartphone brand in Pakistan and enjoys a lion's share in the smartphone market, provides various kinds of phones such as smartphones, feature phones and tablets. It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobileserves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market. Long distance route truck drivers, who transport goods, can use online maps and GPS to plan their routes. Traders in the rural areas can narrow the gap with their buyers and sellers in urban areas by using mobile broadband. Health related services are also available via smartphones. A recent study by the Santa Fe Institute theorizes that cell phone use could help developing countries plan electrical infrastructure.With so much developments taking place, smartphones clearly represent a growing segment of our economy and are an example of how the availability of technology can propel Pakistan in the global marketplace while improving the lives of a common man at the same time.",business

He said Pakistan would have achieved GDP target if it had not missed on targets in agriculture, expressing hope that economic situation would improve due to government's policies.Prime Minister Muhammad NawazSharif on Monday said low agricultural performance during the outgoing fiscal year 2015-16 restricted the economic growth at around 4.7 percent which could have touched 5.7 percent.Poor cotton crop and low commodity prices in the international market contributed to the low agricultural performance in Pakistan which caused one percent less growth of economy, he said.He, however, added that the country was on the path of economic growth and would recover further.The Prime Minister referred to the chairing of NEC andFederal Cabinet meetings through video link and said in theprevailing circumstances it was the best possible way that he adopted and it should be acceptable to all.When asked if the secrecy of budget proposals or related information can be ensured by using the video link method for such meetings, Nawaz Sharif said these were just proposals and not any secret.Budget proposals often become headlines in newspapers one day before these are presented in the cabinet or parliament, he said in a lighter vein.The Prime minister, in response to a query about his health, said with the grace of Almighty Allah he was fine not facing any problem and his health would further improve after the operation on Tuesday.Nawaz Sharif thanked the nation as well as political leaders and others for their prayers and good wishes for him.",business
"SANYA, CHINA: China's efforts to lift local consumption, spur domestic tourism and keep within its borders citizens that splurge in Milan or Seoul have spawned a duty-free paradise on the southern island of Hainan that it hopes will satisfy a lust for luxury.Firms such as the owner of the world's biggest duty-free shopping centre, China International Travel Service Corp Ltd (CITS), are capitalising on a relaxation of duty-free spending restrictions in February, with HNA Group Co Ltd reporting a 160 percent surge in sales.Government initiatives, including 19 more duty-free shops nationwide, come as sales of the types of luxury goods that line duty-free shelves fell 2 percent last year. Market watchers pin the blame on a campaign against demonstrations of wealth among public officials, as well as a slowdown in economic growth.As things stand, the Chinese buy close to 80 percent of their luxury goods abroad in cities such as Paris, London and Tokyo, Bain Consultancy estimated.""Whether it is Burberry or Richemont recently, many brands in the space have noted that the future of luxury demand will be about the Chinese and incrementally at home,"" said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in Hong Kong, who recommends buying CITS shares.LESS CHOICEIn Hainan, which is closer to Hanoi than Beijing, duty-free shops offering products priced as much as 30 percent less than the mainland have been operating since 2011, under a trial program aimed at developing the island as a tourist destination.Customers could initially only buy up to 8,000 yuan ($1,220) worth of duty-free goods, twice a year. From February 1, they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16,000 yuan. At the same time, stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports.In Hainan's provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island, HNA's duty-free sales have since rocketed.In the island's city of Sanya, state-controlled CITS opened the country's first duty-free shopping centre in 2014. The skylit, flower-shaped edifice is about nine soccer pitches in size and filled with shops stocking over 300 brands including from Burberry Group PLC and Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA, as well as goods such as baby formula.""It's definitely much cheaper,"" said 20-something handbag shopper Zhang Pei Pei, ""But the choice of products is less.""CITS declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.HOTEL RUSHHainan's balmy climate and over 60 beaches is a draw for developers, with Sanya on the island's southern tip dotted with luxurious resorts completed or under construction. That city - three times the size of Singapore - has over 1,000 hotels with 30 more due to open in its Haitang Bay area in the coming years.One of those is the $1.7 billion Alantis project of Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd and the owner of South Africa's Sun City casino resort, Sol Kerzner.""Fosun is optimistic in the future development of Sanya,"" the company said in an email to Reuters.Near the capital Haikou, property and aviation conglomerate HNA plans to develop a deep-water port, international sports stadium and motor racing circuit, as well as an artificial isle similar to Dubai's Palm Islands.Its aim is to become the country's first duty-free retail brand, HNA said in emailed comments.COSMETICBut for all the glamour, there are plenty of Chinese ready to spend holiday money on products that are more or less in reach on a daily basis.On one weekday afternoon in CITS' mall, queues snaked out of beauty stores from Chanel SA, Estee Lauder Companies Inc and L'Oreal SA, while the outlets of upmarket watchmakers appeared near-empty.""I just want to buy cosmetics,"" said He, a 30-something from southwestern mainland city of Chongqing, who did not provide her surname. ""For other things like bags, I will just take a look.""In agreement was Huang Cheng, a 26-year-old engineering student from Shanxi province in northern China.""We don't really want to buy the big brands,"" he said, gesturing to the empty watch shops. ""The main reason is just to buy daily necessities.""Hong Kong-based CLSA analyst Aaron Fischer said the limited number of duty-free zones is unlikely to materially boost domestic spending on luxury goods.He also said price was not the only reason for shopping outside of China. Buying luxury goods in the country of origin gives ""a greater feeling of satisfaction,"" he said.($1 = 6.5565 Chinese yuan renminbi)",business
"NEW DELHI/Anil Ambani's Reliance Group has never made a military helicopter, missile system or submarine in its history but that isn't stopping the Indian tycoon from seeking to win contracts to manufacture all of that military hardware and more.Known for taking some ambitious bets over the past decade, some of which have failed to deliver, Ambani's plans to turn Reliance into a major defence company may be one of his boldest yet. It has already bid for 840 billion Indian rupees ($12.5 billion) in government contracts, senior executives said, though it hasn't yet won any of those.The success of the strategy will depend partly on whether he can persuade government officials and international partners that he can build sophisticated equipment and partly on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi can get India's notoriously slow procurement process to work.Modi has made defence a big part of his ""Make in India"" programme. As part of any defence contract, he is demanding foreign companies tie up with a local partner, transfer technology and move some manufacturing to India.At stake is $250 billion in defence contracts the government is expected to award over the next 10 years as it looks to upgrade the military's aging equipment. ""We hope to have a significant share of this pie,"" said R K Dhingra, chief executive of Reliance Defence. He predicted the company will ""emerge as a key player in the defence sector over the next few years.""Reliance's ambition is greeted with scepticism by many in the defence world. An military official involved in defence procurement said Reliance is overreaching in wanting to make everything from ships to planes. Some rivals and potential partners for the contracts said Reliance will struggle to master the manufacture of such a wide range of sophisticated military hardware.""There is no quick money in this branch,"" said Jan Widerstrom, head of Saab India Technologies, a unit of Saab AB. ""It requires a lot of experience, high tech culture, investments and a long-term business plan.""Still, Saab and Reliance are working together in developing the next generation Combat Management System for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard.Recently, Reliance's lack of experience and questions about its ability to handle sensitive technology and intellectual property counted against it in its bid to partner with the Russians to build 200 Kamov helicopters, said a Russian diplomat in New Delhi, who declined to be identified in this story because they weren't speaking in an official capacity.The contract, estimated to be worth a little over $900 million went instead to Indian state-controlled company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Ambani should identify core areas and concentrate on them rather than ""be an inch deep and a mile wide,"" said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defence website Bharat Shakti.RELIANCE GROUPThe Reliance conglomerate split into two in 2005 after a bitter feud between Anil Ambani and his older brother, Mukesh. The latter got the flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining and textiles.Anil got telecoms, power, entertainment and financial services businesses. But some of his businesses struggled, especially an ill-timed foray into infrastructure, and debt piled up.Its Reliance Infrastructure arm, which includes the defence operations, aims to be debt free in the current financial year ending March 2017, according to Lalit Jalan, who is acting CEO of the unit.To get there it plans to sell assets, including road projects and a stake in a power distribution company for about 180 billion rupees, according to another senior Reliance executive. Ambani entered the defence sector last year, when he took a controlling stake in a company that made warships and energy exploration vessels, in Modi's home state of Gujarat, called Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co Ltd, for about 20 billion Indian rupees.That became Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd. Since then, Reliance has bought hundreds of acres of additional land to build an aerospace facility and another shipyard in other parts of the country.It has also signed more than half a dozen joint venture agreements with foreign companies, including one with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems of Israel, to bid for Indian government contracts as they come up.An Israeli defence industry source said for Rafael the idea is that if it wins tenders, Reliance will produce some components for missiles and other systems.BUILDING EXPERIENCEAmbani has said that lack of experience is being held against his company.""Despite a committed reformist mindset at the top, we are still seeing opportunities being denied to new players on grounds of lack of experience,"" Ambani told a 'Make in India' summit on defence in March.Reliance Defence has been building an experienced team. Dhingra earlier headed Lockheed Martin's India operations, and the company has hired a slew of senior army and navy officers who have executed large defence projects from conception to delivery, the Reliance executive said.The group's experience in managing complex projects in India, including building roads and power plants should help it, the executive said. For design, technology and complicated weaponry, Reliance would have a foreign partner, he noted.Reliance expects to spend up to 20 billion rupees over the next three years in upgrading facilities as it gets business, keeping its outlay low as it waits for contracts, the executive said.Thanks to its Pipavav shipyard, Reliance expects the naval part of its business to be the first to take off, he said. It plans to bid for a $7.5 billion submarine contract that the government is expected to give out to replace the navy's ageing and accident-prone fleet and narrow the gap with rival China's rapidly modernizing fleet.Ambani also has plans to bid for contracts in the future to make nuclear-powered submarines.($1 = 67.3 Indian rupees)",business

That was stronger than many forecasts and stemmed from strong consumption in the United States, China and India.U.S. crude output also dropped to its lowest since September 2014 after drillers cut rigs for the ninth week in 10 despite the recent rally in oil prices.However, an expected rise in Canadian oil sands production could weigh on WTI. Suncor Energy (SU.TO) is planning to ramp up output at its fields in Alberta this week after it was forced to shut them down earlier in May because of massive wildfires.Outages because of wildfires in Canada and unrest in Libya and Nigeria helped to push oil prices to a seven-month high in recent weeks.",business

"Pakistan is expected to target tax revenue growth of up to 20 percent by focusing on tax evaders and will offer concessions to the industrial and agricultural sectors to spur growth, analysts said on Thursday, a day before the annual budget was released.Finance Minister Ishaq Dar will release the federal budget in parliament on Friday, in the absence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who is recovering from open-heart surgery in London.Annual budget outlay is expected to be around 4,400 billion rupees ($42.04 billion), with a fiscal deficit target of around 3.8 percent, according to a pre-budget briefing from Topline Securities Ltd, a Karachi-based research organisation.Similar briefings from Arif Habib Research Ltd, Elixir Securities, Foundation Research and other analysts corroborated those expectations, with fiscal deficit expectations ranging between 3.8 and 4 percent.""I think tax increases would be across the board, but right now it looks like non-filers [of income tax] would be the target,"" said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities.""Another target is elimination of subsidies and discretionary tax incentives [for industries].""The government last year targeted tax dodgers by introducing higher rates of withholding taxes on banking and other transactions for those who do not file annual income taxes.The tax revenue target is expected to be around 3,700 billion rupees ($35.35 billion), an increase of 20 percent in absolute terms from last year's target of 3,100 billion rupees ($29.62 billion), analysts say.The government is on track to miss its tax target of 3,672 billion rupees ($35.12 billion) for this fiscal year ending June 30, with tax revenue hitting 2,481 billion rupees ($23.73 billion) through March 2016.Around 200 billion rupees ($1.91 billion) in new tax measures are expected, including the renewal of a so-called ""Super Tax"" of 3 percent (4 percent for banks), imposed last year as a one-time measure to pay for the war against Islamist militants.The ""Super Tax"" targets companies with more than 500 million rupees ($4.78 million) in pre-tax profits, who number in the hundreds in Pakistan, said Sohail.Other additional taxes are expected on commercial gas and electricity connections, sugar, car leases, cigarettes and possibly on non-profit organisations, analysts said.FISCAL DEFICIT TARGETAnalysts expect the new fiscal deficit target may be missed, as Pakistan exits the strictures of an International Monetary Fund assistance package this year and the government prepares for a 2018 general election.On Monday, the government announced 1,675 billion rupees ($16.00 billion) in annual development spending at both the federal and provincial level.On Thursday, Pakistan announced it had missed its economic growth target by 0.79 percent, hitting 4.71 percent growth in the fiscal year ending in June, the highest level seen in eight years.

"After achieving economic stability, the focus of Budget 2016-17 would be on improving economic growth by prioritizing agriculture sector development and promotion of exports, said Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar on Saturday.The Finance Minister stated this while addressing a crowded postbudget press here at P Block Auditorium.He was flanked by Advisor to the Prime Minister on Revenues Haroon Akhhtar, Special Secretary to Finance Ministry Dr. Shuja Ali, Secretary Finance Dr.Waqar Masood Khan, Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Nisar Muhammad Khan, Additional Secretary Finance Tariq Mehmood Pasha and senior officials of the Ministry of Finance.Ishaq Dar said that the two sectors which needed boost for the promotion of countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) were agriculture and exports.He said agriculture provides employment to 45 percent labour forces and 70 percent population is dependent on it while its share in national GDP is about 21 percent, adding negative growth of 0.19 in this sector and 28% reduction in cotton production did affect overall growth rate.He said that provision of relief to agriculture sector was the top most priority of the government so in the budget 2016-17, the prices of Urea fertilizers have been reduced by Rs. 400 per bag from Rs. 1800 to Rs.1400 while the prices of DAP has also been cut from 2800 to 2500 providing 300 relief to farmers.He said the agriculture package announced in the federal budget was devised in consultations with farmers representatives, chambers of commerce and other stakeholders.He said that sales tax on pesticides have also been zero rated while the per unit electricity charges for tubewells has been reduced from Rs.8.85 plus sales tax to Rs.5.35 adding that the provinces have been requested to adjust sales tax keeping in consideration to provide relief to farmers.The Minister said that the second priority sector for boosting growth was to promotion of exports.He said that due to fall in commodity prices in the international market the exports from the county witnessed decline in terms of cost, however the exports of different commodities increased in terms of quantity.He said that Pakistan aimed at enhancing ratio of exports to GDP which is about 15 percent or US 45 billion in emerging economies.He informed that in July this year Pakistan Stock Exchange was likely to be accepted by the international stock market as a frontier market.He said the government was all set to launch Pakistan Microfinance Company which would have potential of providing microfinance facility to 25 million people and would also help in creation of 300 000 new jobs.Moreover, he said when the countrys economic growth would cross 7 per cent, a huge number of new jobs would also be created due to increase in economic activities in the country.",business
"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia: Saudi officials have finalised a detailed plan to diversify the countrys economy away from oil and have sent it for cabinet approval, official media said on Monday.The National Transformation Programme (NTP) will elaborate upon Vision 2030, an 84-page document released in April by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 30, who is leading the reform charge.At the heart of the Vision is a plan to float less than five percent of state oil firm Saudi Aramco on the stock market.The proceeds would become part of the worlds largest state investment fund, with $2 trillion in assets.Profits from the investment fund would help economic diversification and provide an alternative to oil revenues that have fallen by about half since 2014.The collapse has accelerated Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income.The main economic coordinating body, the Council of Economic Affairs and Development chaired by Prince Mohammed, on Sunday night decided to submit the ""final version"" of the NTP to the cabinet for approval, the Saudi Press Agency said.The cabinet normally meets on Mondays. A press conference is expected in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, the summer home of the government, on Monday night.According to Vision 2030, the NTP relates to the governments role ""in implementing the initiatives necessary for delivering on national priorities.""It said opportunities for partnering with the private sector were being looked at, ""as well as innovative administrative and funding approaches. We are detailing specific initiatives that have clear performance indicators.""Among its wide-ranging goals the Vision aims to reduce unemployment, increase womens participation in the workforce, boost private sector economic contributions, and develop cultural and entertainment activities in the kingdom.Saudi Arabia is one of the worlds most conservative societies, but more than half of its citizen population is younger than 25.",business
"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia's National Transformation Plan, a pivotal element of the ""Vision 2030"" reforms announced in April by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, will be put before the cabinet for approval on Monday, a senior Saudi source told Reuters.The plan is expected to flesh out sector-by-sector details of the implementation of Prince Mohammed's programme, which is intended to restructure the kingdom's entire economy and make it less dependent on oil revenue.""The Council of Economic and Development Affairs has approved the final draft of the National Transformation Plan, which is one of the plans adopted and part of the 2030 vision, which was launched and adopted by the Saudi deputy crown prince, president of CEDA,"" the source said.Prince Mohammed was given a central role in decision making after his father, King Salman, became monarch early last year, taking charge of CEDA, a new supercommittee of top ministers charged with overseeing reforms.Saudi Arabia finances now depend on oil revenue and its economic performance closely tracks government spending. But energy prices have plummeted since mid-2014, causing steep declines in income and putting growth at risk.HIGH PROFILEThe wider reforms are expected to include subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment. Last month the International Monetary Fund said the plans were ""appropriately bold and far reaching"".Details of the plan, a programme of wide-ranging economic reforms, will be disclosed in daily news conferences with government ministers starting Monday evening, the senior source said.Other parts of the Vision 2030, including a partial privatisation of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and transformation of the government's Public Investment Fund into one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, have yet to be approved.The emphasis placed on the plan by Prince Mohammed is evident in the high-profile nature of its launch, with senior ministers expected to deliver rare briefings on how their departments will implement the programme.The timing is also significant because Monday is the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when business and government activity in the conservative Islamic kingdom have historically slowed down. Launching the plan despite the start of the holiday signals a more energetic approach.Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totalled $98 billion in 2015.The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.",business

An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect,"" he said, referring to a portal supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Modi promised in his 2014 election campaign to recover billions of dollars sent to tax havens abroad to avoid income tax, now about 30 percent in India.Schneider-Ammann said no figure had been put on the amount of ""black money"" to be recovered. Talks would begin later this month, he said.Modi said Switzerland had also agreed to support its bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which it applied to join last month, having won a waiver in 2008 that accorded it the right to trade in commercial nuclear technology.New Delhi's bid for full membership of the 48-nation club, if granted, would tip the balance of power in South Asia against its arch-rival Pakistan, whose own application has been backed by China despite questions over its proliferation record.Modi tacked on Switzerland and Mexico as extra stops on a five-country tour to seek their support on joining the NSG. He left Switzerland for Washington, where U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to offer his backing also.Both Switzerland and Mexico have been viewed as sceptical about India's bid for nuclear legitimacy.

"A worried World Bank slashed its growth forecast for the global economy Tuesday, saying advanced economies are rebounding more slowly than expected and low commodity prices continue to hurt other countries.The Bank said that the global economy should grow at just 2.4 percent this year, the same lethargic pace of 2015 and much slower than the 2.9 percent it predicted in January.It said that the slow growth in advanced economies is holding back developed countries, with world trade and investment both depressed, and called for Prospects for a pickup ""remain muted,"" the Bank said, in a report especially downbeat for countries dependent on commodity exports like oil.It said risks to growth have risen since the beginning of the year, particularly the high level of borrowing by companies in developing countries, which has left them vulnerable to credit crises as growth stagnates.It also includes the rise in doubts that the aggressive monetary easing in developed countries, with negative interest rates in several, is doing the intended job of firing up economic activity.""Economic growth remains the most important driver of poverty reduction, and thats why were very concerned that growth is slowing sharply in commodity-exporting developing countries due to depressed commodity prices,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.""This sluggish growth underscores why its critically important for countries to pursue policies that will boost economic growth and improve the lives of those living in extreme poverty.""The report comes as the main developed country drivers of global growth -- Japan, Europe and the United States -- struggle for traction.A sharp deceleration of the US economy since the beginning of the year is not helping carry the rest of the world, and the World Bank has cut its expectations for the worlds largest economy by 0.8 percentage point to 1.9 percent in 2016.The Euro area will achieve only 1.6 percent growth, and Japan, fighting off deflationary pressures, will manage just 0.5 percent.In all three, the bank said, investment remains soft amid doubts about the efficacy of policies, particularly those of central banks holding interest rates at extraordinarily low levels.China, the other major wheel of growth, will manage to hold onto a 6.7 percent pace, but the Bank sees it slowing further to 6.3 percent by 2018.India too is holding onto a good pace, helped by the cheap prices of key commodities it imports, including oil.But other large emerging economies like Brazil and Russia remain locked in recession, and Nigeria and South Africa are expanding very slowly.""Conditions remain markedly challenging for commodity exporters,"" the Bank said.",business

Islamic trade finance, which follows religious principles such as a ban on interest, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars of bank-intermediated trade finance conducted globally every year.But the ITFC, which uses its expertise and funds to facilitate Islamic trade finance, says it is expanding its activities partly through new business with countries outside the traditional core areas of sharia-compliant finance in the Gulf and southeast Asia.Last month, it signed financing agreements with Djibouti, Comoros, Mali and Mauritania, and is exploring transactions in Guyana, the newest member of the IDB Group, Sonbol said. The ITFC approved transactions worth $6.1 billion in the financial year to last October, up from $5.2 billion a year earlier. It more than doubled financing approvals to sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey saw some of the biggest individual increases in approvals.Difficulties in the global economy could dampen further growth but the ITFC aims for around $7 billion of approvals this year, Sonbol said.Traditionally, Islamic banks have not become heavily involved in trade financing as it often requires large balance sheets; they have left such business for Western banks to dominate.To overcome this, the ITFC has developed a network of more than 70 financial institutions which last financial year provided $4.2 billion via 25 syndicated deals, representing 68 percent of the institutions total trade financing.The rest came from its own resources. Strategic partnerships are growing: Last year, the ITFC closed a $350 million export syndication in favour of Turkeys export-import bank, and in February it signed a partnership agreement with Moroccos largest lender by assets, Attijariwafa Bank.The ITFCs mandate is to promote trade among countries of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Trade within the group accounted for 19.5 percent of OIC countries total trade in 2015, up from around 12 percent in 2011, and the ITFC aims for 26 percent by 2025, Sonbol said.The IDB is the largest shareholder in the ITFC with 37.6 percent of paid-up capital; Saudi Arabia holds second place with 16.9 percent.<br/> Last year, the ITFCs general assembly approved an increase of Irans subscription by 8,500 shares, which once paid would allow it to take third spot behind Saudi Arabia.",business

"Fears Britain is on the verge of voting to leave the European Union next week spread through global financial markets on Monday, sending Asian and European shares sharply lower and the pound to an eight-week low.With the world economy looking shaky, and surprisingly weak jobs figures last month suggesting even the United States is not ready for higher interest rates, concerns over the economic fallout of a Brexit have lurked in the background for weeks.They were at the heart on Monday of the biggest falls for Asian stock markets in four months, and a 1 percent drop in European share prices, after a new poll late on Friday gave the ""Leave"" camp a 10 point lead.Money markets have now abandoned expectations, high just weeks ago, that the U.S. Federal Reserve could raise official borrowing costs on Wednesday. Instead, the worry is that it could use language that quells expectations of a move this year at all.""We're in uncharted territory in front of the Brexit vote, and then there's also the Fed this week. So the wall of worry is quite high at the moment,"" said Zeg Choudhry, managing director at LONTRAD.""All the banks are a little bit lower, and they're the ones which are likely to get hit. For the next two weeks, you've got to be slightly mad if you've not got your money in defensive stocks.""The news out of China, global investors' other big concern this year, was also poor, with data showing investment growth cooling. Stock markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai all fell by around 3 percent.By comparison, the moves in Europe, where investors have been preparing for the British vote for months, were more subdued. Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1 percent, Germany's DAX 0.9 percent, and France's CAC 40 by 0.8 percent.On currency markets, sterling fell another half a percent against the dollar after sinking by as much as 3 full cents in value on Friday. The biggest beneficiary of the global moves, however, was the yen, traditionally investors' first choice in times of financial and economic stress.Further gains for the Japanese currency, which broke past long-term resistance around 106.50 yen per dollar and is up 14 percent this year, puts more pressure on the Bank of Japan to act against the currency's strength this week.""While the pound is the worst-performing G10 currency versus the dollar this year, the yen is by far the best,"" said Derek Halpenny, European Head of Global Markets Research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in London.""The continued surge of the yen will lift expectations that the BOJ may surprise the markets and announce some additional monetary easing.""The grim mood was visible on commodities markets, where crude oil futures added to Friday's 3 percent drop after data showed the U.S. oil drilling rig count rose for the second week in row.Gold, another perceived safe haven, hit four-week highs above $1,280 an ounce.",business

Pakistan has a 70 percent chance of being promoted, according to Tundra Fonder, a fund manager specializing in frontier markets.The countrys benchmark index rallied the most in five weeks before MSCIs decision due late Tuesday in New York.Pakistan is moving into acceptance: the nation has what it needs, a decently functional state and decent stability, said Mattias Martinsson, the Stockholm-based chief investment officer at Tundra Fonder, which holds $200 million of Pakistani equities.We have a pretty fair chance, said Farid Ahmed Khan, the Karachi-based chief executive officer at ABL Asset Management Co.Pakistan was downgraded to frontier status in December 2008, four months after the Karachi Stock Exchange imposed a rule that caused near total paralysis of market activity for more than three months.MSCIs Frontier Markets Index currently features 16 Pakistani companies that make up about 9 percent of the gauge.Pakistans market has been doing so well as valuations are some of the lowest in the region, said Arthur Kwong, the Hong Kong-based head of Asia-Pacific equities at BNP Paribas Investment Partners, which oversees about 552 billion euros ($623 billion).Basically people are looking for alternatives, finding markets that are less correlated to the U.S. interest-rate cycle and the China macro slowdown.

"Pakistan could end energy rationing within two years, the Asia Development Bank (ADB) country director for Pakistan said on Monday, adding weight to government claims that they will end frequent outages in time for the 2018 elections.Analysts say if Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government manages to eradicate ""load-shedding"", the electricity rationing system which leads to several hours of scheduled outages every day, it would significantly boost his chances of securing another term in office.Pakistan's economy has been hobbled by energy shortages over the past decade, with businesses saying they deter foreign investment and hurt productivity. Electricity shortages were among the main election issues in the 2013 poll won by Sharif.ADB is lending Pakistan more than $1 billion over five years as part of efforts to end chronic energy crisis and implement reforms such as privatising parts of the sector and improving transparency.Werner Liepach, ADB's country director for Pakistan, said the bank was ""broadly satisfied about progress being made"" in Pakistan with energy sector reforms.When asked at a news conference if load shedding could be eradicated in two years, Liepach was categorical: ""Yes"". He added it was possible to be done even sooner but it would depend on other factors, such as global oil prices.Sharif's government has made reducing energy shortages a top priority, embarking on construction of new dams, coal-fire power plants and renewable energy projects.Energy Minister Khawaja Asif said the South Asian nation had last week hit record production generation of 17,350 megawatts (MW), though production shortfalls varied between 1,500MW and 4,700MW through the week.",business

"KARACHI/Pakistani stocks are soaring, improved security is fuelling economic growth and the South Asian nation will be upgraded to ""emerging market"" status by index provider MSCI.But for Ali Saigol, co-founder of a private equity firm, convincing foreign investors to overlook the country's violent past and bet on its economy remains a hard sell. He said pitches often encountered the same problem: Pakistan's image.After a turbulent decade in which Islamist militants staged frequent gun and bomb attacks on cities, some investors still refuse to visit Pakistan and insist on meeting Saigol in Dubai.""Most people have never been to Pakistan. It's a huge problem,"" said Saigol, sipping a cappuccino in an upscale cafe in Islamabad, Pakistan's leafy, affluent capital.""When people visit Pakistan, they see it's actually opposite of what they expect.""Saigol's frustration goes to the heart of Pakistan's struggle to attract foreign investment and boost economic growth from 4.7 percent towards above 6 percent, the minimum level experts say is needed to absorb new entrants into the job market in a nation of 190 million people.Pakistan's $250 billion economy is growing at the fastest pace in eight years but only attracted $1 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the nine months to April. FDI inflows into Indonesia, by comparison, hit $29 billion last year.Many businesses in Pakistan have flourished since 2014, when a military offensive against Islamist groups improved security.Violence is down overall, although deadly attacks are not uncommon. In late March, more than 60 mostly women and children were killed by a suicide bomber in Lahore.In major cities, car sales are rising and shopping malls are sprouting to cater for an expanding middle class.A crime crackdown in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub of 20 million people, has helped spur a real estate boom and new, upmarket seaside restaurants and cafes are overflowing.PERCEPTIONS TAKE TIME TO CHANGEThe progress is in stark contrast to economic instability during the past decade, when the stock market collapsed and Pakistani Taliban militants held territory 100km from Islamabad.The militants have since been contained in small pockets in mountainous areas near the Afghan border and the country's stock market is Asia's best performing index in 2016.""Perceptions change with a lag. Our reality has changed, but it takes a little while for investors to realise that,"" said Miftah Ismail, an adviser to the prime minister tasked with bringing foreign investment into Pakistan.Ismail said he had expected more money to flow from abroad by now, and concedes investors need convincing that Pakistan ""will not revert to type"" by running large deficits and facing foreign exchange crises.Investors will also have to be convinced that political risks are easing in a nuclear-armed nation surrounded by countries with whom it has unstable relations, including arch-foe India.Yet there are tentative signs foreign companies are eyeing Pakistan's fast-growing consumer market.Carmakers Renault-Nissan are considering a plant in Pakistan, and Suzuki, which already has a presence, said it may invest $460 million for a new factory.A Dutch dairy cooperative, FrieslandCampina International Holding, in March announced plans to buy a stake in Pakistani food giant Engro Foods, in a deal estimated at $460 million.INDICATORS ""FLASHING GREEN""Omar Hamid, head of Asia Pacific country risk research for IHS, said interest in Pakistan has soared this year by IHS corporate clients seeking country and political risk analysis.""It's a massive consumer market and the economic indicators are flashing green for many international companies,"" he said.Pakistan's interest rates are at 42-year lows, inflation has been tamed at about 3 percent, the currency is stable and foreign exchange reserves have jumped to all-time highs.The economy is also expected to receive a shot in the arm from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $46 billion roads and energy project.Much of the money is earmarked for power stations to ease chronic electricity shortages which hobble business and investment.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government is so confident about the economy that it plans to end the IMF's $6.7 billion financial assistance programme in September. Analysts say this could prove a risky move if oil prices spike.In Karachi, the business community hopes MSCI's upgrade of Pakistan will herald a return of foreign investors who fled in anger in 2008 when the bourse imposed a floor and trapped them in a collapsing market for three months.""What happen in 2008 could never happen again,"" said Haroon Askari, deputy director of the Pakistan Stock Exchange.Pakistan's main benchmark index has risen more than 500 percent since the start of 2009, but is still considered cheap by some, trading at multiples below other emerging markets due to political and security risks associated with Pakistan.Saigol, founding partner of Baltoro Capital, which manages a new $48.5 million private equity fund, said foreign investors who finally take a serious look at Pakistan are often surprised.""They say they have never seen a country or an economy the size of Pakistan with so little coverage, so under the radar.""",business

"Switzerland's watch industry exports fell nearly 10 percent in May as watchmakers continued to struggle with the aftermath of last year's extremist attacks in Europe and a prolonged slowdown in Asia.Exports of timepieces fell 9.7 percent on a nominal basis to 1.55 billion Swiss francs ($1.61 billion), according to data released by the Swiss customs office on Tuesday.The fall followed declines of 11.1 percent in April and 16.1 percent in March. Overall this year Swiss watch exports, which are seen as a proxy for sales, have fallen by 9.5 percent.Particularly badly hit have been China and Hong Kong, two of the world's largest markets for luxury watches which are made by companies like Swatch (UHR.S), Richemont (CFR.S) and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMH.PA).Europe has also been struggling, with reduced tourism numbers in the wake of Islamist attacks last year reducing the number of visitors to important luxury shopping destinations like Paris.Exports to France fell 18.4 percent in May, according to figures from the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry.In response, watchmakers have been cutting costs and production as the industry faces its biggest slowdown since 2009 when the global financial crisis reduced demand for luxury watches.Last month, Geneva-based Richemont said it expected business to remain tough in the months ahead, as it reported a 1 percent fall in its constant sales for the 12 months ended March 31.The owner of Cartier and IWC brands said April had been particularly difficult with sales down 15 percent in the month when currency swings were removed.Difficulties in Richemont's watches business were exacerbated by inventories at retailers, which forced the company to buy back unsold watches.No further job cuts were planned on top of the 500 cut last year, but more stores could close in China, Richemont said last month.",business
"The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday the US economy was ""overall in good shape"", with growth set to accelerate from recent setbacks despite an overvalued dollar, but the Fund warned that too many Americans were living in poverty.The IMF expects US growth to be 2.2 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017, with inflation rising slowly toward the Federal Reserve's goal of two percent, it said in a statement at the conclusion of its annual review of US economic policies.""At today's level of the real effective exchange rate, the current account deficit is expected to rise above 4 percent of GDP by 2020, pointing to the US dollar being overvalued by 10-20 percent,"" the IMF said in its report.The IMF said among the biggest risks to future US growth were another downdraft in global demand, declining participation in the labor force as the population ages, and too many Americans living in poverty, about one in seven people and one of every three households headed by a female.It urged US policymakers to take steps to increase labor force participation, including improving child-care and other family-friendly benefits to draw more women into the workforce, pursuing immigration reforms and reworking the disability insurance program to allow for part-time work.It also called for the United States to raise the federal minimum wage while at the same time providing a more generous earned-income tax credit, and improving early childhood education.",business
"The World Bank has approved financing worth $1.02 billion using three different financing instruments to support the deepening of Pakistans economic reforms and to strengthen the capacity of Sindh province to deal with natural disasters.The Competitiveness and Growth Development Policy Financing (CGDPF) would support the Government of Pakistans efforts to encourage economic growth and investment for reducing poverty and building shared prosperity, Illango Patchamuthu, World Banks Country Director for Pakistan, said in a statement here Wednesday.Illango Patchamuthu,The Government of Pakistan has made significant progress in stabilizing the economy, initiating reforms for revenue mobilization and drawing in the private sector for spurring growth.He said it was now stepping up efforts through deeper reforms and an accelerated pace of implementation. This would improve the competitiveness of the economy, which in turn would create more and better jobs, lifting millions out of poverty.The CGDPF, he said, would provide $920 million in budget support to improve the business environment and strengthen fiscal management.The financing combines a credit of $500 million and a World Bank guarantee of $420 million, he added.The operation will support reforms that contribute towards accelerating growth and fostering an inclusive growth pattern, said Enrique Blanco Armas, Task Team Leader of the Project.Reforms supported will improve the business environment and contribute to the development of the financial sector and reforms of state owned enterprises. The operation also supports efforts for improved fiscal management through increased revenues, better coordination of debt management and making public spending more pro-poor.The World Bank guarantee is an innovative instrument that will support Pakistans access to international markets to meet its budgetary financing needs.The World Bank will guarantee up to $420 million of financing to be raised by Pakistan, improving the terms under which the Government of Pakistan accesses international financing, and freeing domestic resources for private sector investment.Sindh Resilience Project (SRP) of $100 aims to reduce flood and drought risks in selected areas of Sindh and to strengthen the provinces capacity to manage natural disasters.The project would contribute to reduction in vulnerability and risk in Sindh through a combination of physical works, strengthening fiscal resilience, and institutional development activities, says Haris Khan, Task Team Leader of the project.An estimated 5 million people, including both urban and rural populations, will be directly protected from frequent river flooding events.In addition, an estimated 65,000 people who are currently exposed to drought and food insecurity, will also be directly benefitting from the construction of small dams for rain water harvesting and recharging of groundwater aquifers.The CGDPFs Development Policy Credit will be financed from the International Development Association (IDA), the World Banks grant and low interest arm.The credit will be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.The SRP will have a maturity of 24 years, including a grace period of 5 years.",business

"State Bank of Pakistan has issued guidelines on prevention against cyber attacks. Through these guidelines, the SBP has advised banks/MFBs/DFIS to continuously improve their cyber security controls and procedures so as to anticipate, withstand, detect, and respond to cyber attacks.SBPs cyber security instructions provide guidelines in the areas of risk ownership and management responsibility; periodic evaluation and monitoring of cyber security controls; regular independent assessment and tests, and industry collaboration and contingency planning.The new instructions require the Board of Directors (BoD) of the institutions to regularly evaluate the adequacy of cyber security systems and action plans with regard to emerging cyber threats. The senior management is required to ensure that an organizational plan of action for cyber security management exists in each institution and is regularly reviewed and updated for implementation.It may be noted here that cyber threats have become a global phenomenon and are continually growing in sophistication and impact, despite the advances in cyber-security technologies and practices.SBP has always proactively strived to provide an enabling regulatory framework in order to cope with new threats. While the new technologies and their application in banking system has created new opportunities for the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services, these have also posed a number of new threats and risks.The banks/DFIs/MFBs are required to make necessary arrangements to comply with the instructions latest by December 31, 2016.",business
"Ireland would have to consider taking steps to assist firms exporting into Britain if its nearest neighbour and largest trade partner votes to leave the European Union, Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan told Reuters on Wednesday.Ireland's economy is more vulnerable than any other in the EU if Britain opts to leave, and ministers including Flanagan have campaigned in Britain ahead of Thursday's referendum to urge Irish voters living there to vote ""Remain"".Irish exporters would be the first to suffer if Brexit significantly weakened the pound against the euro and Flanagan said concerns had been raised in meetings with trade bodies during the campaign.""It's too early for me to speculate as to the nature of any actions that we may take but we are fully sensitive to the challenge that lies ahead and the need to respond accordingly,"" Flanagan said when asked if there were any policy steps that could aid exporters.DUBLIN: ""In the event of there being a vote to leave, we would be primarily focussed on strategic national Irish interests across a range of issues, primarily economic and trade, so we have prepared a plan across a range of departments.""Around 1.2 billion euros ($1.35 billion) of goods and services are traded between the United Kingdom and Ireland each week with Irish farmers and food producers, major UK suppliers, particularly vulnerable.Flanagan, serving a second term as foreign minister after his Fine Gael party returned to office last month, also predicted any withdrawal negotiations could take much longer than the two-year period laid down in EU law.Of most concern to Ireland during such a process would be the impact on Northern Ireland, which has the only land frontier between the United Kingdom and the rest of the EU.While pro-Brexit campaigners say a vote to leave would not endanger a common travel area that predates both countries' entry into the EU in 1973, Flanagan said he could not see why the reintroduction of a hard border would not be considered.Given the prominence of immigration as a campaign issue, he said, it would seem logical that Britain would be inclined to take some action if it was outside the EU. In that case, Dublin was concerned that the negotiation on a form of border would be done at EU level and therefore not entirely under its control.The fear for many is that any new border restrictions could endanger an 18-year-old peace agreement between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and their Protestant rivals who want to keep Northern Ireland British.""At best, I would point to a period of uncertainty that would affect the great progress that has been made (in Northern Ireland) in recent years,"" Flanagan said in his office in Dublin's government buildings.""And in terms of the peace process, any re-introduction of border controls, either in terms of custom controls for trade or in terms of security, that could well pose us with a difficult challenge.""",business

"NEW YORK/Global capital markets reeled on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, with $2 trillion in value wiped from equity bourses worldwide, while money poured into safe-haven gold and government bonds. Sterling suffered a record plunge.The blow to investor confidence and the uncertainty the vote has sparked could keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as planned this year, and even spark a new round of emergency policy easing from major central banks.The traditional safe-harbor assets of top-rated government debt, the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose more than 5 percent and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to lows last seen in 2012 at 1.5445 percent.Stocks tumbled in Europe. London's FTSE dropped 2.4 percent while Frankfurt and Paris each fell 6 percent to 8 percent. Italian and Spanish markets, and European bank stocks overall, were headed for their sharpest one-day drops ever.Worries that other EU states could hold their own referendums were compounded by the fact that markets had rallied on Thursday, seemingly convinced the UK would vote to stay in.Britain's big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds, Barclays and RBS plunging as much as 30 percent.Stocks on Wall Street opened more than 2 percent lower but cut losses after about an hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 340.24 points, or 1.89 percent, at 17,670.83, the S&amp;P 500 lost 42.11 points, or 1.99 percent, at 2,071.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.74 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,793.31.MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 3.5 percent.Having campaigned to keep the country in the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would step down.Results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.More angst came as Scotland's first minister said the option of another vote for her country to split from the UK - rejected by Scottish voters two years ago - was now firmly on the table.The British pound dived by 18 U.S. cents at one point, easily the biggest fall in living memory, to its lowest since 1985. The euro, in turn, slid 3 percent to $1.1050 as investors feared for its very future.Sterling was last down 7.8 percent at $1.3719, having carved out a range of $1.3228 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.""It's an extraordinary move for financial markets and also for democracy,"" said co-head of portfolio investments of London-based currency specialist Millennium Global Richard Benson.""The market is pricing interest rate cuts from the big central banks and we assume there will be a global liquidity add from them,"" he added.That message was being broadcast loud and clear. The Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People's Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability.SHOCKWAVESThe shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions.The safe-haven yen jumped 3.6 percent to 102.29 per dollar, having been as low as 106.81. The dollar's peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.That prompted warnings from Japanese officials that excessive forex moves were undesirable. Traders said they were wary of being caught with exposed positions if the global central banks chose to step in to calm the volatility.Emerging market currencies across Asia and eastern Europe and South Africa's rand all buckled on fears that investors could pull out. Poland saw its zloty slump 4 percent.Europe's natural safety play, the 10-year German government bond, surged to send its yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid almost 5 percent, Tokyo's Nikkei saw its worst fall since 2011, down 7.9 percent.Financial markets have been gripped for months by worries about what a British exit from the EU would mean for Europe's stability.""Obviously, there will be a large spill-over effects across all global economies ... Not only will the UK go into recession, Europe will follow suit,"" predicted Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at fund manager Perpetual in Sydney.BOND RALLYInvestors stampeded into low-risk sovereign bonds, with U.S. 10-year notes gained two full points in price to yield 1.521 percent. Earlier, the yield dipped to 1.406 percent, only slightly higher than a record low 1.38 percent reached in July 2012.Right now its 'every man for himself' safety buying,"" said Tom Tucci, head of Treasuries trading at CIBC in New York.The rally even extended to UK bonds, despite a warning from ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's that it was likely to downgrade Britain's triple-A credit rating if it left the EU. Yields on benchmark 10-year gilts fell 27 basis points to 1.0092 pct.Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.""A July (hike) is definitely off the table,"" said Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon.Fed funds futures were even toying with the chance that the next move could be a cut in U.S. rates.Oil prices slumped by more than 4 percent amid fears of a broader economic slowdown that could reduce demand. U.S. crude shed $2.12 to $47.99 a barrel while Brent fell as much as 6 percent to $47.83 before clawing back to $48.60.Industrial metal copper sank 3 percent but gold galloped more than 6 percent higher thanks to its perceived safe haven status.",business

"The pound collapsed to a 31-year low and there was pandemonium on currency, equity and oil markets Friday as Britain voted to leave the European Union, fuelling a wave of global uncertainty.Sterling crashed 10 percent to $1.3229 at one point, its weakest level since 1985, while the greenback itself slumped below 100 yen for the first time in two-and-a-half years as traders fled to safety.In the weeks leading up to Thursdays historic vote, there had been widespread warnings that a ""Brexit"" would cause a rout across global markets that would wipe trillions off valuations, just months after a painful China-fuelled sell-off.The doomsday scenario appeared to be playing out as markets suffered one of their worst days since the 2008 financial crisis after final results confirmed one of the EUs big three economies would leave the bloc after four decades.Fears are also growing that other EU members will push for referendums, posing the biggest threat to the future of grouping since its inception almost 60 years ago.The pound had earlier topped $1.50 following predictions the ""remain"" group would win, but as the Brexit camp posted early victories around the country, traders stampeded to put in sell orders.

"Panama City: Panama is preparing to officially open its canal this weekend to far bigger cargo ships after nearly a decade of expansion work aimed at boosting transit revenues and global trade.On Sunday, a VIP ceremony will be held on the banks of the canal to inaugurate the completion of the works.President Juan Carlos Varela will unveil the new locks and third shipping lane built into the 102-year-old canal. Foreign dignitaries, including the presidents of Taiwan, Chile, and other Central American nations, will be present at the ceremony.A Chinese-owned Neopanamax-class cargo ship will be the first vessel to officially test the new infrastructure, entering from the Atlantic and exiting into the Pacific a few hours later.The Neopanamax vessels are much bigger than the Panamax-class ships that previously were the largest able to pass through the 80-kilometer (50-mile) long canal. Each is able to haul three times as much cargo as the smaller predecessors.The expansion work began in 2007 and was meant to have been completed in 2014, but it ran well past deadline, and over budget.The expansion is estimated to have cost $5.5 billion. But there are outstanding disputes between the Spanish- and Italian-led consortium that carried out the work and the Panamanian government that could hike that figure by hundreds of millions more.<br/> <br/> For Panama, the unveiling of the broader canal is a moment of pride and of opportunity.Now, ships as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall, and as broad as Olympic-sized swimming pools, will be able to use the canal.Annual cargo volumes should double over the next decade, leading Panama to hope to triple the $1 billion in shipping fees it receives each year.Also, with the country these days linked to the ""Panama Papers"" scandal of offshore businesses owned by the worlds wealthy and influential, the expanded canal is seen as a chance to burnish the countrys tarnished image.This will show the ""real face of Panama,"" the head of the Panama Canal Authority, Jorge Quijano told AFP in an interview this week.World trade should also benefit from what will essentially be an inter-oceanic highway for goods between the United States and Asia. More cargo on bigger ships should mean lower transport costs.Panama is also avidly eying the lucrative market of transporting liquefied natural gas between the United States and Asia, principally to Japan.The ships carrying the gas were too big to use the old canal.

"British financial markets were engulfed in further turmoil on Monday, with 10-year government borrowing costs sinking below 1 percent for the first time and sterling hitting a 31-year low against the dollar as investors bet Britain's vote to leave the EU will trigger a Bank of England rate cut.Billions of pounds were wiped off the value of British bank stocks as a political vacuum and economic uncertainty opened up by Thursday's referendum prompted widespread downward revisions to the outlook for UK growth, sterling and interest rates.Sterling fell as low as $1.3122 , a decline of almost 4 percent to its lowest since September 1985, and bond yields chalked up their biggest two-day fall since the BoE started its quantitative easing bond buying binge in March 2009.The market value of Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland is down by a third in just two days, meaning the UK taxpayer has lost 8 billion pounds since Thursday via the Treasury's 72 percent stake in RBS.""The UK economy is headed for recession,"" analysts at Llewelyn Consulting said on Monday.""Potential output has been cut at a stroke (and) the country's large twin deficits leave it exposed to capital flight.

"European and Asian stock markets built on a recovery from the aftermath of last week's Brexit vote on Wednesday as investors wagered central banks would ultimately ride to the rescue with more stimulus.UK and European banks, a center of concern since Britain shocked global financial markets on Friday by voting to leave the European Union, were broadly higher, extending a recovery from two days of trading which knocked almost 40 percent off shares in Barclays and RBS.Sterling, the other big victim on Friday and Monday, rose around 0.6 percent against the dollar to recover a full 3 cents of Friday's 18-cent fall to 31-year lows.Stock markets in Frankfurt, Paris and London all gained more than 2 percent in morning trade .FTEU3 while the pan-European index of major banks was up 1.6 percent.

"MANILA, Philippines: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $600 million loan program, with a first subprogram of $300 million, to help Pakistan roll out major structural reforms to improve the performance and financial sustainability of its public sector enterprises.Many large public sector enterprises rely on fiscal transfers from the federal government just to run their day-to-day operations, and there is no available funding for longer term capital spending and development, said Werner Liepach, Country Director for ADBs Pakistan Resident Mission.This assistance will give the government the fiscal breathing space it needs to proceed with measures to create more sustainable businesses, delivering more efficient and cost-effective services to the Pakistani public, and will eventually free up public funds for vital social sector spending.The federal government owns 191 public sector enterprises employing around 420,000 workers. A fiscal consolidation drive to improve federal finances has constrained the federal government from carrying out important reforms related to the public sector enterprises, including a reduction in contingent liabilities from pensions and other related costs. Among enterprises that need immediate financial support for initiating important reforms are power distribution companies and Pakistan Railways.The full program will help the government draw up and roll out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the financial transparency of public sector enterprises and to strengthen their corporate governance. It will include support to establish a retirement cost fund to manage huge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers. Unfunded pension risk presents a serious threat to the financial health of the enterprises.Measures to strengthen auditing, accounting and other elements of operations at Pakistan Railways will also be supported by the program, along with actions to improve the performance of federal financial sector entities to boost financial inclusion in the country.The program is part of a broader, coordinated donors package for public sector enterprise reforms, with other assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The program loans will be extended in two equal subprograms of $300 million each, with the first subprogram running for a year to June 2017 and the full program finishing in June 2018.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration. Established in 1966, ADB in December 2016 will mark 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members-48 from the region.

"Cotton imports by Pakistan are expected to remain near record-high levels in the year to July 2017, as erratic weather forces farmers in the worlds fourth-biggest producer to trim area under the crop, industry officials said.A supply crunch in Pakistan, at a time when back-to-back droughts have taken a toll on output at top producer India, could boost global cotton prices from their current near 11-month highs.The two countries have already taken turns this year to buy from each other to fill shortages at home.""Cotton area in Pakistan is down around 15 percent. Despite the government and industrys efforts, farmers in top-producing Punjab have reduced area,"" said Saleem Saleh, acting secretary general of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA).Unpredictable weather, such as floods late last year as well as poor rainfall in recent months, and the resultant uncertainty about yields is putting many farmers off cotton, stymieing Pakistans efforts to boost local output.""Farmers are finding other crops profitable,"" said Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association.The countrys cotton output fell by a third to 9.7 million bales in 2015/16, forcing it to import a record 4 million bales in the year, up from 1.2 million a year ago, according to APTMA.Pakistan annually consumes around 15 million.Even for the season starting Aug. 1, weather has not been supportive and the crop in Punjab has already been hurt by poor rains in May and June, said Khan.Cotton sowing in Pakistan starts from April and harvesting begins in July.While the country has set a production target of 14.1 million bales for the new season, industry officials say output will fall short and that rainfall over the next few weeks will be crucial in determining yields.""Import requirement is rising as local consumption is rising, but production is stagnant.This year imports jumped due to crop failure. Next year also imports would remain around this years level. Actual number depends on production,"" Saleh said.Typically lower output in Pakistan implies an exporting opportunity for neighbouring India.In fact, the latter shipped out about 6.5 million bales this season, with Pakistan taking nearly 2 million.""India has freight advantage over other suppliers. Naturally India will be the preferred choice for buyers in Pakistan whenever they start imports,"" Cotton Association of India President Dhiren Sheth said.However, Indias move to contract 20,000 bales from Pakistan for import this month indicates supply at the top producer is also running thin.",business

"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar: Myanmars annual jade and gems sale netted more than 530 million euros ($587 million), an official tally showed Thursday, as Chinese buyers continue to drive a shadowy industry linked with rebel conflicts and notorious for perilous working conditions.Lusted after by wealthy Chinese, Myanmars jade mines were in the hands of the military and their crony elites during the junta years and are still believed to raise tens of billions of dollars in undeclared sales.While the price of the green stone has slipped in recent months, thousands of poor migrant workers still risk their lives to comb unstable pits in northern Myanmar for jade fragments.Hundreds of slabs of jade worth 527 million euros were bought during the 12-day sale in the capital Naypyidaw, according to government figures, with around six million euros-worth of gems and pearls also snapped up.The event, which drew 895 Chinese companies, is the countrys only official jade sale.""We displayed fewer lots of jade than the previous emporium... so we also received less money than the previous one,"" Than Zaw Oo, of state-owned Myanma Gems Enterprise told AFP, without giving last years sale total.Anti-corruption campaigners say the real value of Myanmars jade runs into the tens of billions of dollars annually.Powerful syndicates linked to smuggling rings and rebel commanders slip tonnes of the precious stone across the northern border to China each year, depriving the state of huge sums of income.Most of the worlds best quality jadeite -- the rarer and more expensive of two minerals containing jade -- is mined in Hpakant, a strip of torn earth in Myanmars insurgency-wracked northern Kachin state bordering China, a country with a voracious demand for the precious stone.Jade is widely believed to be an important revenue stream for the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) which is resisting ceasefire overtures in its fight against Myanmars army.Jade mines have also long been a dangerous workplace for the itinerant miners who scratch a living from the stone -- around 100 people died in a major landslide in November last year.The falling price of jade in recent months has been attributed to customs action in Chinas border area, deterring smugglers and leading to a glut.",business
"Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday its second-quarter operating profit likely rose 17.4 percent from a year earlier, its highest in more than 2 years as Galaxy S7 smartphone sales propelled mobile earnings.The world's top maker of smartphones and memory chips said its April-June profit was likely 8.1 trillion won ($7 billion), better than the average forecast of 7.8 trillion won tipped by a Thomson Reuters survey of 16 analysts. It was the highest since a 8.5 trillion won profit in the first quarter of 2014.The mobile division likely was the top earner for the second straight quarter, raising the question of whether the South Korean company can sustain this strong momentum in the face of competition from Apple Inc and cheaper Chinese rivals.""At this point it appears unlikely that we'll see stronger competing devices emerging (in the second half),"" IBK Asset Management fund manager Kim Hyun-soo said.Apple's new iPhones - likely to launch around September - would not offer any dramatic new features, Kim said.While Samsung will not disclose detailed results until late July, its shares rose on the guidance.

"US employers added new workers at a surprisingly strong rate in June after an unnerving stall in May, in a clear demonstration of economic resilience, the Labor Department reported Friday.The much better-than-expected numbers gave a boost to markets in the US and Europe, which have been battered down by worries that Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union will drag down economic growth.Private businesses and government authorities across the United States generated 287,000 new positions last month, 112,000 more than analysts had expected.The strongest hiring was in the health care, hospitality, information and retail sales sectors, while government hiring also picked up.That largely compensated for the poor numbers from May that had shocked policymakers and markets, sending the dollar lower and contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to put off an interest rate hike.The May job creation numbers in fact were revised downward in Friday's data from the original 38,000 reported to just 11,000.June's hiring levels boosted the monthly average of the last three months to a solid 147,000, which economists say is adequate to keep bringing down unemployment overall.""This is a good trend but nothing spectacular.

"BRUSSELS: The European Union on Tuesday followed the United States to launch a new legal challenge at the World Trade Organization over duties and quotas China imposes on its raw materials exports.The EU said China is violating WTO rules with restrictions on exports of key materials such as graphite, cobalt, chromium and magnesia which help Chinese industry at the expense of European companies and consumers.""We cannot sit on our hands seeing our producers and consumers being hit by unfair trading practices,"" the EUs top trade official Cecilia Malmstroem said in a statement.The EU launched similar successful actions against China in 2012 and 2014 over rare earths and raw materials like bauxite, zinc and coke.The new challenge targets export restrictions on graphite, cobalt, copper, lead, chromium, magnesia, talcum, tantalum, tin, antimony and indium.""The past two WTO rulings on Chinese export restrictions have been crystal clear -- these measures are against international trade rules,"" Malmstroem said.""As we do not see China advancing to remove them all, we must take legal action,"" she added.In filing a similar action last week before the WTO, the US government said that when China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to eliminate such export duties but had failed to follow through on the commitment.The US action covered nine of the 11 materials mentioned in the EU action, excluding chromium and indium.These raw materials are essential for a broad range of industry, from aerospace and car manufacturing to electronics and chemicals.In Washington, the US trade representatives office said Chinas export duties ranged from five to 20 percent, raising prices for overseas buyers while Chinese companies paid much less and had more secure supplies.In addition, the export duties put pressure on non-Chinese manufacturers to shift production, technologies and jobs to China, it said.As with the US challenge, the EU action launches formal consultations with China as a first step to settle the dispute.If the two sides fail to reach a settlement in 60 days, the EU may decide to ask the WTO to establish a panel to determine whether Chinas measures are compatible with the Geneva-based bodys rules.The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, is due Wednesday to review trade links with China ahead of a December deadline whereby, under the terms of its WTO accession, the country should be regarded as a normal market economy, not one where the state plays a central role.",business
"Shares of Japan's Nintendo Co soared another 14 percent on Tuesday, more than doubling the firm's market capitalisation to 4.5 trillion yen ($42.5 billion) in just seven sessions since the mobile game Pokemon GO was launched in the United States.The phenomenal success of Pokemon GO - now available in 35 countries, the majority in Europe, and most recently in Canada - has triggered massive buying in Nintendo shares, surprising even some seasoned market players.""I've never seen the trend of such a big company's shares changing so quickly in such a short period of time,"" said Takashi Oba, senior strategist at Okasan Securities.Nintendo shares ended Tuesday up 14.4 percent at 31,770 yen, bringing its gains to more than 100 percent since the launch of the game on July 6.Turnover in Nintendo shares hit 703.6 billion yen, surpassing the record for trading turnover in individual shares it set on Friday, of 476 billion yen.Trading in Nintendo shares roughly accounted for a quarter of the entire trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board.The success of Pokemon GO, unforeseen even by its creators, has boosted hopes that Nintendo could capitalise on a line-up of popular characters ranging from Zelda to Super Mario to strengthen its new foray into augmented reality.""Virtual reality and augmented reality have been a focus of the market but hardly anyone was expecting Nintendo in this area. Suddenly Nintendo has become an AR-related stock,"" said a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm, who declined to be named as he is not allowed to discuss individual shares.The fund manager said the big gains were justifiable considering the likely boost to Nintendo's bottom line.""Under my rough estimate, the sales from Pokemon GO and upcoming related gadgets will boost net profits by 50 billion yen.

"One of Indias most high-profile Hindu temples said Wednesday it now accepts shares of listed companies as donations in a novel departure from the usual gifts of cash and gold.Mumbais Siddhivinayak temple, which Apple chief executive Tim Cook visited in May, allows generous devotees to transfer their stocks electronically to an account run by the religious sites trust.""We have opened up a share and securities option for devotees globally,"" trust chairman Narendra Murari Rane told AFP, adding that the stocks would be converted into cash.""The stocks cannot be used for trading purposes,"" Rane explained.Hundreds of thousands of worshippers pray at Siddhivinayak temple -- dedicated to the elephant-headed deity Ganesh -- every day, including Indian cricketers, politicians and Bollywood film stars.Situated in the south of Indias financial capital, it is one of the wealthiest temples in India, receiving donations of around 750 million rupees ($11.19 million) a year in cash, silver and gold.As well as donations, Hindus also seek the blessings of their favoured gods by making religious offerings at shrines, such as fruit, incense sticks and flowers.Rane hopes Indians who like to invest on the Bombay Stock Exchange will be inclined to give some of their shares to Siddhivinayak in the hope that it will boost their fortunes.""Many devotees who enter the Indian stock market want an auspicious start. Hence, they might seek blessings by promising to donate shares to the temple,"" he said.The temple trust decided to pursue the scheme after another temple in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh last year became the first to accept stocks as donations, Rane added.The trust uses donations to finance charitable hospitals and schools for underprivileged societies across Indias western Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital.",business
"GENEVA/In a packed Christie's auction room in Geneva, one could hear a pin drop as two anonymous bidders slugged it out in their quest to own the world's most exquisite blue diamond.The room in the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues was filled with multi-millionaire collectors and diamond dealers, listening intently as the bidders, each speaking by phone to a Christie's representative, took turns adding a few hundred thousand dollars in a tense struggle dragging on for more than half an hour.When the auctioneer's hammer came down, spontaneous applause broke out as the winner, who retained anonymity, bought the 14.62-carat Oppenheimer Blue for a world record $57.5 million for any jewel sold at auction. The sale some weeks ago was the latest in a series of world record prices per carat paid at auction for extraordinarily magnificent and rare diamonds.With new fortunes being created around the world faster than at any time in history, more of this expanding elite of wealthy investors are looking at different ways of protecting cash that now earns close to zero percent interest in bank accounts, while asset market turbulence can wipe out millions in hours.Some are eyeing rare diamonds as a best friend, or long-term haven at least. And it's no longer just a top table of ""super rich"" billionaires who are gravitating to this arcane world.A second division of wealthy is emerging. They can't afford the Oppenheimer Blue, perhaps, but they can take a stake in rare diamonds via specialist investment funds.PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS' CLUB ONLYThese gem specialists are keen to play up rare diamonds as ""safety"" investments, or at least a way to hedge against currency, stock and bond market volatility at a time of political and economic uncertainty. Britain's shock vote last month to leave the European Union underlines their point.""The big players are looking at diamonds in a different way,"" said Ehud Laniado, chief executive of Cora International, which sold the 12.03-carat Blue Moon diamond for $48.4 million at a Sotheby's Geneva sale in November, a world record for any jewel sold at auction at the time.""They are not looking at them just as a jewel, but as an asset that has a resale value.""Citigroup said the outlook for gold remained uncertain partly due to concerns about a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. In such a scenario, investors may look at a next-best alternative such as diamonds.However, the diamond investors' club is shut to most ordinary savers due to its complicated, insider nature - characterised by poor liquidity, a lack of price transparency and high fees. While some are making efforts to create a liquid market, the process has been slow.Entry level for Sciens Coloured Diamond Fund II, one of the more established closed-end funds now shut to new investors, is $1 million. It invests in diamonds in rare colours such as red.The fund, which manages around $50 million, uses trading and buy-and-hold strategies for long-term appreciation. One of its strategies is to improve the value of stones by finding a rare matching pair in the same colour, size and shape. They are eventually sold to buyers such as jewellers and collectors.Some funds also loan diamonds to jewellers who wish not to maintain a large inventory. If the jeweller decides to make a unique ring for a client, he can buy a diamond from the fund.The Sciens fund, launched in 2014, rose in value by about 5 percent in the second quarter of 2016, said Philip Baldwin, managing director of Sciens Diamond Management BV. He and Mahyar Makhzani run the fund, based on the Caribbean island of Curacao.""Colour diamonds are considered a safe haven,"" he said. ""Colour diamonds are a hedge against inflation, currency risk, market fluctuations and political uncertainty.""Solitaire Diamond Co, another diamond-backed fund now closed to new investors, is backed by an assortment of white diamonds of high-grade clarity and cut weighing under 5 carats, which are certified by international laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America.Fred Sinclair-Brown, Solitaire fund manager, said it made a gross margin of 20 percent over the past 12 months, above expectations of 14 to 16 percent. He said he was planning another diamond fund for professional investors, this time possibly backed by coloured gems.INVESTORS SEE SPARKLE IN COLOUR GEMSPrices of vivid and intense colour diamonds have risen 10 to 12 percent a year on average since 1959, according to Baldwin. However, dealers said white diamond prices had not gained as quickly in recent years and were largely flat in 2016.The most prominent white diamond to come to auction recently, the 1,109-carat Lesedi la Rona, failed to sell at Sotheby's in London last month, highlighting that diamond markets are not bulletproof.Diamond markets slowed in the second quarter as selective buyers pushed for deeper discounts. Polished inventory continued to rise and prices came under pressure, while rough trading remained resilient.Despite a handful of diamond-backed initiatives, fund managers have struggled over the years to find the right investment vehicles for diamonds due to illiquidity, a lack of price transparency and high transaction fees.""I am very dubious about diamond-backed investment because the price of diamonds is not listed anywhere and the market is too illiquid,"" said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas and former global equity fund manager of BCS Asset Management.Fund managers pointed to very separate markets for white diamonds. While white diamonds can be correlated to the commercial market for bridal jewellery, colour gems are in a unique investment category. Part of the problem with diamond investing is that different categories make it difficult to compile generic prices.A recent Citigroup poll found that about one-third of the respondents were willing to invest in a diamond product having homogeneity and liquidity.Martin Rapaport, head of the Rapaport Group, which has its own polished diamond price list widely used by the trade, is trying to create a more liquid market for investment-grade diamonds by developing a transparent price structure. He hopes to launch a fund backed by diamonds within a couple of years.""Diamonds can be a good investment, but you have to be careful,"" he told Reuters. ""You need to know the bid/ask spread, the price you can sell diamonds back on the same day.""",business

"Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.The Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",business
"Its been an eventful few days for Mohammad Basheer Abdul Khadar, an Indian living in Dubai.In the space of a week, he survived a crash landing at Dubai airport then won $1 million in a lottery organised by the airports duty free operator, Gulf News reported.The 62-year-old was flying home from holidays with family in India when the Boeing 777 in which he was travelling caught fire on landing with 300 people on board.The accident on Wednesday shut down the Middle Easts busiest airport for several hours, forcing authorities to cancel hundreds of flights. All the passengers and crew escaped unharmed, but a firefighter died tackling the blaze.Just six days later, Khadar discovered that the lottery ticket hed bought on the way to India was now worth $1 million.A fleet administrator with a Dubai car dealership, Khadar told Gulf News he habitually bought a lottery ticket on his way to visit family in the southern Indian state of Kerala.Ticket number 845 in the ""Millenium Millionaire"" draw at the airports Dubai Duty Free proved to be his winning shot.""I live a simple life, and now that its my time to retire, I feel like God gave me a second life when I survived the plane crash, and blessed me with this money to follow all this up by doing good things,"" he told Gulf News.Khadar has lived in Dubai for 37 years and is married with two children, one of whom is paralysed after a fall early on in his childhood, reported Gulf News.Khadar told Gulf News he was planning to return to Kerala to retire and would use the money to help children in Kerala who need financial support.He said he earns around $2,200 (2,000 euros) a month, and would continue to work as long as he could.""Nothing else can give you the satisfaction of your hard-earned money,"" he said.",business
"The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.The Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages, he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",business

"From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britains decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.The consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the countrys tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pounds plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar groups London office.""We wouldnt expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices,"" he told AFP.""Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.""- Diluted purchasing power -Price comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming ""fears of Brexit"" for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexits tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.""It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited,"" warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.""Companies may well look to clamp down on workers pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.""Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",business

"At an Innisfree cosmetics store in Seoul's popular Myeongdong shopping district, a saleswoman helps 21-year-old Chinese tourist Yang Hui carry her shopping baskets to the pay desk in front of a large display showing K-Pop star Yoona</.""There's a lot to choose from,"" said Yang, confessing to having bought more than she'd planned from the store's range of around 900 products.South Korea's top cosmetics company Amorepacific Group (002790.KS) launches some 400 new Innisfree branded products a year, about half of which are no longer available a year later.It's one of dozens of Korean mass cosmetics brands with a short product development cycle - a ""fast beauty"" approach that is increasingly popular among Chinese and other Asian millennials, gaining exposure in the United States and Europe, and attracting high-profile foreign investment.South Korea has become a hot-bed for applying to cosmetics the ""fast fashion"" principles of shifting designs quickly from catwalk to Main Street to capitalise on new trends.Thousands of small cosmetics firms compete to get their new products to market, with third-party manufacturers cutting the time on testing and recipe alignment and providing the capacity for swift market launch.Korean brands have cut product development cycles to as little as four months, compared to over a year for global brands, industry experts say.""When we received an eyeshadow order from a major global client in 2004, it took us two years to begin production. Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.WINNING FORMULASouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has announced it will release the last instalment of a $6.6 billion economic bailout package to Pakistan, as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif hailed an end to the countrys reliance on the lender.The decision to release the final tranche worth $102 million of the three-year programme came after a review of the countrys economic performance that found it was meeting most reform indicators but still needed to broaden the tax net.IMF delegation head Harald Finger said growth was projected to reach five percent supported by a construction boom linked to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, an ambitious infrastructure upgrade project intended to link Chinas western Xinjiang region to Gwadar port on the Arabian Sea.""All indicative targets and structural benchmarks (SB) were met, except for the delayed notification of multi-year tariffs for three power distribution companies,"" Finger said Thursday in Dubai, referring to measures intended to reduce major fluctuations in electricity costs.The release of the final tranche is subject to approval by the IMFs executive board though that is considered a formality.In Islamabad, Sharif told lawmakers from his party that his government had ended the countrys reliance on foreign multilateral assistance and was saying ""goodbye"" to the Fund.""With the grace of God, we will say goodbye to IMF after this (agreement),"" he said.Sharif had been under pressure from the opposition for seeking the loan in 2013 because its conditions included forcing the government to raise taxes and energy prices.The IMF note cautioned however that to consolidate and reinforce the gains achieved in the last three years, it was important to ""strengthen public finances and external buffers, broaden the tax net, (and) improve public financial management,"" among other measures.",business

"Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.The Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",business

Forecasts had called for a much more modest increase of 185,000 jobs.Private businesses and government employers added 292,000 jobs in June, not the 287,000 first reported, and 24,000 jobs in May, not the very low, downward-revised figure of 11,000.""This months report confirms that the Great Recession is indeed in the nations rearview mirror -- the economy has added jobs for 70 consecutive months, the longest streak on record,"" Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said.On the White House campaign trail, Clinton has painted a picture of optimism and jobs growth, while Trump has cast America as an economy in decline -- Fridays numbers can only help Clinton.The Trump campaign sought to downplay the news, with senior policy advisor Stephen Miller saying the recovery was the weakest since the Great Depression, with conditions largely disfavoring working people.""Entire communities have been wiped out by off-shoring,"" said Miller.<br/>""Many workers today are earning less than they did in 1970, and household incomes are down nearly $2,000 under the Obama administration.""/>Fed rate hike?The closely watched jobs figures help fill out a complex economic picture for market observers eager for signs of whether the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates later this year.Monetary policy makers earlier this year veered off a course of planned, successive rate hikes as some signs emerged that the American economy might not be on sure footing.The Commerce Department said last month that economic activity had grown by a paltry 1.2 percent in the second quarter.But that data was at odds with Fridays rosier jobs report. ""Employment rose in all sectors of the economy, helping to keep the rate of unemployment at 4.9 percent amid an increase in the number of people entering the labor market looking for work,"" said Chris Williamson of IHS Markit.""Adding to the good news was an improvement in pay growth. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent against expectations of a mere 0.2 percent rise,"" said Williamson, noting that pay growth was still below pre-crisis rates.Gains were strongest in professional and business services, with 70,000 new jobs added, and in health care, where 43,000 new jobs added. Together, both sectors have added nearly a million jobs in the last 12 months, according to the Labor Department.Employment in mining continued to fall, losing 6,000 positions from the prior month and putting the industry down 220,000 jobs since a peak hit in September 2014.The average workweek rose 0.1 hours to 34.5 hours while average hourly earnings inched upwards by 8 cents to $25.69, up 2.6 percent since the start of the year./>Stocks upEquities markets reacted favorably to the news, with the S&amp;P 500 closing at 2,182.87, about four points above the all-time record set last month.The tech-rich Nasdaq Composite also set a record, closing up 1.1 percent at 5,221.12 while the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 1.0 percent at 18,543.53, only 12 points from its record.""We believe the trend remains more than strong enough to keep the unemployment rate declining over time,"" said Jim OSullivan of High Frequency Economics.""Todays report helps the case for more Fed tightening before too long -- if strength is sustained -- although officials are being ultra cautious/dovish as they worry about downside risks,"" he added.",business

""There's a lot of oil there, and we don't need more of it.""Meanwhile, the number of oil rigs drilling in the United States rose for the sixth consecutive week to 381.The combination of factors led analysts to warn that the world had not yet dealt with the overhang of physical oil, which could drag prices lower again before any sustained recovery.""The proper signals are not yet being sent to fix the product market,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note, noting that refined products also needed to draw down a large excess.""In other words, physical oil markets likely need to get worse before they get better.""",business

"Switzerland's highest court has ordered Israel to pay Iran around $1.1 billion plus interest in a decades-old dispute over a secretive oil pipeline company predating the 1979 Islamic revolution which made the countries enemies.The Swiss Federal Tribunal rejected an appeal, citing lack of due process, against an arbitration ruling last year. The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",business

All the passengers and crew escaped unharmed, but a firefighter died tackling the blaze.Just six days later, Khadar discovered that the lottery ticket hed bought on the way to India was now worth $1 million.A fleet administrator with a Dubai car dealership, Khadar told Gulf News he habitually bought a lottery ticket on his way to visit family in the southern Indian state of Kerala.Ticket number 845 in the ""Millenium Millionaire"" draw at the airports Dubai Duty Free proved to be his winning shot.""I live a simple life, and now that its my time to retire, I feel like God gave me a second life when I survived the plane crash, and blessed me with this money to follow all this up by doing good things,"" he told Gulf News.Khadar has lived in Dubai for 37 years and is married with two children, one of whom is paralysed after a fall early on in his childhood, reported Gulf News.Khadar told Gulf News he was planning to return to Kerala to retire and would use the money to help children in Kerala who need financial support.He said he earns around $2,200 (2,000 euros) a month, and would continue to work as long as he could.""Nothing else can give you the satisfaction of your hard-earned money,"" he said.",business
"The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.The Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages, he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",business

"From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britains decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.The consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the countrys tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pounds plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar groups London office.""We wouldnt expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices,"" he told AFP.""Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.""- Diluted purchasing power -Price comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming ""fears of Brexit"" for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexits tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.""It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited,"" warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.""Companies may well look to clamp down on workers pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.""Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",business

"Anyone with internet access and a passion for seafood will soon be able to track commercial fishing trawlers all over the world, with a new tool that its developers hope will help end the overfishing that has decimated the world's fish stocks.Millions of people depend on fish to survive, and fish will be vital to feeding the world's growing population that is predicted to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, the United Nations says.But overfishing has diminished fish stocks, and illicit fishing is threatening people's access to food in many poor countries, according to the United Nations.""We currently have around 450 million people globally who get their primary source of food from the ocean. This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.""If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally,"" he said.""We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.""An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",business
"Oil prices eased slightly in Asia Thursday amid reports OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia would further raise output in August.Prices hit five-week highs this week, supported by hopes that a Russian-Saudi cooperation may reach a pact to freeze output, easing the stubborn supply glut dogging the market since late last year.OPEC members and their non-OPEC rivals are to meet informally in Algeria next month, and both Saudi and Russia have indicated they could discuss measures to stabilise prices.The market was boosted further on Wednesday after the weekly US inventories report showed significant declines in commercial crude stockpiles, indicating strong demand in the worlds top oil consumer.US crude stockpiles fell by 2.5 million barrels in the week to August 12, and gasoline stocks declined 2.7 million barrels, official data showed.Analysts however, said gains were being eroded by media reports that Saudi Arabia, OPECs top producer, is ramping up production to fresh record levels in August.Saudi output was at a record 10.67 million barrels per day in July.""The upside is capped by Saudis signals of pumping more oil in August, which could give the Kingdom more leverage during talks in Algeria next month,"" said EY Services oil and gas head Sanjeev Gupta.""The oil market will continue to seesaw amid scepticism over the coordinated efforts to stabilise output,"" he told AFP by email.At about 0500 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery was down two cents to $46.77 while North Sea Brent was down 16 cents to $49.69.

"THATTA: U.S. Consul General Brian Heath visited a mango farm in Tando Hafiz Shah to inspect automated mango graders and processors provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).USAID Deputy Mission Director Denise Herbol and Deputy Provincial Director Patrick Brady were also present.The United States is helping Pakistan boost domestic and international sales of Pakistani agricultural products, including mangoes, said Consul General Heath.We want to make Pakistani mangoes as competitive as they can be in international markets, he said.Pakistan is the fifth largest mango-producing country in the world, but exports less than 8 percent of its production.Pakistani mango exports to the U.S. doubled last year, setting a record at 184 metric tons, and there is even more potential in this area, said Mr. Heath.USAID, through its Agricultural Market Development (AMD) project, is increasing access to new markets for Pakistani mango farmers, while ensuring better prices through improving compliance with international grading standards and export protocols.USAID supplied top-of-the-line automated mango graders imported from one of the worlds leading manufacturers as well as training farmers how to use them to the best advantage.USAID launched the U.S.-Pakistan Partnership for Agricultural Market Development in February 2015 to increase production and sales of products, including meat, vegetables, mangoes and citrus.This partnership promotes cooperation among farmers, processers, exporters and buyers of agricultural products from Pakistan.",business
"Grain millers in Bangladesh are boosting their wheat purchases from Russia and Ukraine as cargoes from key exporter India fade due to a supply squeeze in that country.Bangladesh has booked about 800,000 tonnes of wheat from the Black Sea region for shipment between mid-July and October, up from around 550,000-600,000 tonnes in the same period last year, two trade sources said.Strong demand from South Asia's top wheat importer and other key buyers could help buoy benchmark futures, which have been recovering from a 10-year low of $3.99-1/4 a bushel hit earlier this month due to pressure from plentiful global production.""India is out of the market, Bangladesh buyers are taking larger volumes of feed wheat as well as milling grade wheat from Russia and Ukraine,"" said one Singapore-based trader.""It is all about prices, most Bangladeshi millers take the cheapest origin.""Buyers paid $155-$168 a tonne, free on board, for Black Sea feed wheat with about 10.5-percent protein content, the sources said. They declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.For milling wheat with 11.5- to 12.5-percent protein, importers have paid $165-$180 a tonne FOB, they said.India has been exporting wheat to Bangladesh for the last few years, but its recent crops have been hit by a severe drought linked to the El Nino weather pattern and by unseasonable rains.BIN-BUSTINGRussia and Ukraine, two of the Black Sea region's leading wheat producers, have seen bin-busting grain production.Ukraine's 2016 grain harvest is likely to be around 3 million tonnes bigger than the year before at around 63 million tonnes, agriculture ministry official Leonid Sukhomlin said earlier this week.And Russia is facing a lack of grain storage as it remains on track to produce the largest cereal crop in post-Soviet history, said the head of Russia's Grain Union.But analysts warned against relying too heavily on shipments from the Black Sea.""Worldwide, many countries are depending on Russia to supply much of their wheat and that is risky,"" said one agricultural commodities analyst.

"New York has knocked off London as the world's premier city for foreign investment in commercial real estate due to fears the vote to leave the European Union would diminish the British capital's appeal as a global financial center.Data on cross-border property transactions indicate greater unease among investors prior to the referendum, which voters unexpectedly approved on June 23, than had been captured in the capital markets prior to the vote.Cross-border capital flows into London real estate fell 44 percent in this year's first six months from the same period in 2015, according to data from brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.Property investors feared Britain's exit from the EU would erode London's role as a premier financial center and reduce the value of their investments, the majority of which are office buildings.Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of Britain's largest foreign investors, said on Wednesday it cut the value of its UK property portfolio by 5 percent because of the vote.""It would be fair to say that London bore the brunt of Brexit fears,"" David Green-Morgan, director of global capital markets research for JLL in Chicago, said in an interview. ""The big fear is that London will lose a lot of the financial service jobs that has made it such a global financial center.""New York gained $10.3 billion in cross-border investments in the first six months of the year compared with the $6.9 billion that London took in, data from JLL show. In the same year-ago period, London garnered $12.4 billion while $11.3 billion flowed to New York, according to JLL.The 8.9 percent decline in cross-border investment New York experienced is in-line with the roughly 10 percent decline major cities experienced this year when compared to 2015, a stellar year in property investment around the world.Concerns the UK market was coming toward the end of the cycle amid signs pricing was reaching unsustainable levels only partially explains the drop-off in investment flows to Britain, the largest decline since the financial crisis.It is now obvious that people were becoming increasingly nervous about the Brexit vote, Green-Morgan said.Britain is viewed as more investor friendly than the United States because of beneficial tax arrangements. However, underlying property fundamentals - strong demand and not too much supply - must be in place to attract capital, as now is the case for the U.S. office and multifamily real estate sectors.The uncertainties created by Brexit has made investors more cautious about Britain and to a lesser extent about Europe, said Ken McCarthy, senior managing director, regional research director for Tri-State New York at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

"Indian gold refiners just months ago were ramping up capacity and struggling to secure enough ore from miners. Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.Gold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called ""grey market"" where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.""Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations,"" James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.""Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold. With local scrap supplies we can produce 20 tonnes of refined gold in the current year,"" said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.SMUGGLING GROWSIndia raised the duty on gold imports to 10 percent three years ago, aiming to dampen buying and narrow the current account deficit in a country where gold is seen as a store of wealth for rich and poor alike.Smugglers evade the duty and offer cheap gold to buyers such as bullion dealers and small jewelers, who can pay up to $100 an ounce below official domestic prices, currently around $1,340 an ounce.Falling gold prices deterred the illicit trade last year but smuggling has surged in recent months amid rising prices and the reintroduction in March of a 1 percent local sales tax on gold jewelry.Smuggled gold into India could double to as much as 300 tonnes in 2016, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, although the World Gold Council (WGC) has put the figure at 160 tonnes. At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.BANKS HITThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.""Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets,"" Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.""So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent,"" he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.""Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount,"" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.""The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.""I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.""In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

"Pakistan is taking another step towards becoming a key buyer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), signing a deal to purchase a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) for its second import terminal.Singapore's BW Group said in a statement on Monday that it would deliver the FSRU to Pakistan GasPort Limited (PGPL) in the fourth quarter, as well as providing the terminal at Port Qasim, Karachi with LNG regasification services in a 15-year agreement.The South Asian country has been earmarked as an up-and-coming demand outlet for the oversupplied LNG market.

It was dealt further blows in July when a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice. Two weeks later, two men killed a priest in a small town in Normandy.

"SINGAPORE/Chinese state-backed firms are frontrunners to buy a $1.5 billion controlling stake in Pakistani utility K-Electric, sources said, as they bet the benefits of a Beijing-led economic corridor will trump the risks of investing in Pakistan.State-backed Shanghai Electric Power (600021.SS) and China Southern Power Grid are among Chinese firms leading the pack of about half a dozen bidders in K-Electric KELA.KA, one person familiar with the matter said.Shanghai-headquartered Golden Concord Holdings is also among the bidders, as are some local Pakistani and other companies, according to people who know about the process.Chinese companies' interest comes after China last year announced energy and infrastructure projects worth $46 billion in the South Asian nation, with a view to opening a trade corridor linking western China with the Arabian Sea.""The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the main driver, with a lot of Chinese funding flowing into Pakistan,"" said one person aware of the K-Electric deal.That demand underpins President Xi Jinping's ambitious ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, under which Beijing is seeking to open new trade routes and markets as the domestic economy slows.Under the program, Chinese companies invested nearly $15 billion in participating countries last year, up one fifth from 2014.If successful, the K-Electric deal would be the biggest M&amp;A agreement in Pakistan in a decade. Large tracts of Pakistan's economy remain nationalized or held by private businessmen with little interest in selling to new investors.Chinese firms are eyeing new Pakistan power projects, roads and some engineering contracts but investing in a large private company that deals directly with consumers would be a first, a senior Karachi-based financial adviser said.NO GUARANTEEDubai-based private equity firm Abraaj Group, whose 66-percent stake in K-Electric has a market value of about $1.5 billion, is seeking final bids for its stake by the end of August.Sources cautioned that although talks between the parties are advanced, there is no certainty of a deal being clinched.The Pakistani government owns about 24 percent, but a spokesman for the water and power ministry said it was not in talks to sell.CPEC envisages the construction of roads, pipelines and power plants across Pakistan that run south to Gwadar port and should mean more business for distribution companies like K-Electric that sell the electricity to users.China and Pakistan call each other ""all-weather friends"" and their ties have been underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbor, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S. influence in the region.Islamabad wants Chinese funding to reinvigorate an economy hurt by militant violence and weak productivity, to provide new jobs and to ease chronic power shortages.For China, markets like Pakistan and Malaysia are opening up new frontiers, just as it faces hurdles in countries including Australia.""CHINESE ARE COMING""""We are getting a lot more enquiries from Chinese investors about Pakistan in the last couple of years,"" said Muhammad Sohail, CEO at Karachi-based brokerage Topline Securities.""Before it was always U.S. and Europe. The Chinese are coming,"" Sohail added.Still, foreign investment in Pakistan remains relatively muted as it struggles to shake off a reputation for violence, corruption and instability, and despite the $250 billion economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years.Inbound M&amp;A into Pakistan has risen more than six times in the past five years, totaling $516 million so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.K-Electric, Pakistan's biggest electricity company, supplies power to over 2.2 million customers in and around Karachi, the country's biggest and wealthiest city.The utility has undergone a turnaround since Abraaj bought it; K-Electric has cut down on electricity theft and reduced outages.""Abraaj has done a good job but for a newcomer to get involved in a city like Karachi is not easy,"" said the Karachi-based adviser, referring to a city where power theft, violence and political turmoil have scared investors away.""The Chinese are looking at a lot of things but they are also very cautious.""Sources said some Pakistani firms were also bidding, but it was not clear how keen they were, and they would likely find it tough to match the Chinese in an auction which could go as high as $2 billion.China Southern Power Grid declined comment, while Shanghai Electric Power confirmed it was bidding but gave no details.A K-Electric spokeswoman said the company had not been notified about any transaction or acquisition.

"SINGAPORE/Chinese state-backed firms are frontrunners to buy a $1.5 billion controlling stake in Pakistani utility K-Electric, sources said.State-backed Shanghai Electric Power and China Southern Power Grid are among Chinese firms leading the pack of<br/>about half a dozen bidders in K-Electric, one person familiar with the matter said.Shanghai-headquartered Golden Concord Holdings is also among the bidders, as are some local Pakistani and other companies, according to people who know about the process.Chinese companies interest comes after China last year announced energy and infrastructure projects worth $46 billion in the South Asian nation, with a view to opening a trade corridor linking western China with the Arabian Sea.""The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is the main driver, with a lot of Chinese funding flowing into Pakistan,""<br/>said one person aware of the K-Electric deal.That demand underpins President Xi Jinpings ambitious ""One Belt, One Road"" initiative, under which Beijing is seeking to open new trade routes and markets as the domestic economy slows.Under the programme, Chinese companies invested nearly $15 billion in participating countries last year, up one fifth from 2014.If successful, the K-Electric deal would be the biggest M&amp;A agreement in Pakistan in a decade. Chinese firms are eyeing new Pakistan power projects, roads and some engineering contracts but investing in a large private company that deals directly with consumers would be a first, a senior Karachi-based financial adviser said.NO GUARANTEEDubai-based private equity firm Abraaj Group, whose 66-percent stake in K-Electric has a market value of about $1.5<br/>billion, is seeking final bids for its stake by the end of August.Sources cautioned that although talks between the parties are advanced, there is no certainty of a deal being clinched.<br/>The Pakistani government owns about 24 percent, but a spokesman for the water and power ministry said it was not in<br/>talks to sell.CPEC envisages the construction of roads, pipelines and power plants across Pakistan that run south to Gwadar port and should mean more business for distribution companies like K-Electric that sell the electricity to users.China and Pakistan call each other ""all-weather friends"" and their ties have been underpinned by long-standing wariness of their common neighbour, India, and a desire to hedge against U.S.influence in the region.Islamabad wants Chinese funding to reinvigorate an economy hurt by militant violence and weak productivity, to provide new jobs and to ease chronic power shortages.For China, markets like Pakistan and Malaysia are opening up new frontiers, just as it faces hurdles in countries including Australia.""CHINESE ARE COMING""""We are getting a lot more enquiries from Chinese investors about Pakistan in the last couple of years,"" said Muhammad<br/>Sohail, CEO at Karachi-based brokerage Topline Securities.""Before it was always U.S. and Europe. The Chinese are coming,"" Sohail added. Still, foreign investment in Pakistan remains relatively muted as it struggles to shake off a reputation for violence, corruption and instability, and despite the $250 billion economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years.Inbound M&amp;A into Pakistan has risen more than six times in the past five years, totalling $516 million so far this year,<br/>according to Thomson Reuters data. K-Electric, Pakistans biggest electricity company, supplies power to over 2.2 million customers in and around Karachi, the countrys biggest and wealthiest city.The utility has undergone a turnaround since Abraaj bought it; K-Electric has cut down on electricity theft and reduced<br/>outages.""Abraaj has done a good job but for a newcomer to get involved in a city like Karachi is not easy,"" said the<br/>Karachi-based adviser, referring to a city where power theft, violence and political turmoil have scared investors away.""The Chinese are looking at a lot of things but they are also very cautious. ""Sources said some Pakistani firms were also bidding, but it was not clear how keen they were, and they would likely find it tough to match the Chinese in an auction which could go as high as $2 billion.China Southern Power Grid declined comment, while Shanghai Electric Power confirmed it was bidding but gave no details.

"A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U.S. big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high-end fiber market: there isn't much Egyptian cotton any more.The shortage of cotton from Egypt, which commands a premium due to its superior quality, creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether, cotton traders said, exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years.Welspun India has lost 42 percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer, one of the world's largest, accusing it of substituting cheaper, non-Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases.Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is ""long staple"" or ""extra long staple,"" meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high-end cotton than Egypt, cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop.But Egypt's cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass-produced items made from short- or medium-staple fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The decline has become a full-fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies, and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice, the USDA said.Egypt will produce just 160,000 480-lb bales of cotton in 2016/17, down from 1.4 million bales as recently as 2004/05, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of expected global output.This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not, or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure, said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville, South Carolina.""If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale, and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that's produced, it would lead one to scratch one's head,"" Lea said.A GOLD SEAL?Long and extra long staple cotton is rare - it makes up just 2.5 percent of annual world cotton production of more than 100 million bales, according to the USDA - and trades at a substantial premium.U.S. extra long staple cotton, or ""pima,"" trades for 152.25 cents per lb, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, a 125 percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U.S., a contract that accepts cotton of a ""strict low middling staple length"".Ron Lawson, a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma, California, said he had ""no idea"" what Egyptian cotton prices were, which he said showed how much of a ""novelty"" item the fiber was.Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U.S. Textile Act and Rules, which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target's allegations or had started an investigation.Egypt's cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting. In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's ""Gold Seal,"" which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was ""an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.""The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.""The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now,"" Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.",business

"Australian defence officials warned French naval contractor DCNS to beef up security in Australia, where it is preparing to build a A$50 billion ($38.13 billion) fleet of submarines, in the wake of a massive data leak, a government spokesman said on Friday.DCNS was left reeling after more than 22,000 pages outlining details relating to submarines it is building for India were published in The Australian newspaper earlier this week, sparking concerns about its ability to protect sensitive data.A senior Australian defence official, acting on orders from Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne, warned DCNS that the government was deeply concerned by the implications of the leak, a spokesman for the minister told Reuters.DCNS is locked in exclusive negotiations with Australia to build a fleet of 12 next-generation submarines after seeing off its rivals, Germany's Thyssenkrup AG and a Japanese government-backed consortium of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Heavy Industries.DCNS said earlier this week that the leak, which covered details of the Scorpene-class model and not the vessel currently being designed for the Australian fleet, bore the hallmarks of ""economic warfare"" carried out by frustrated competitors.TKMS Australia, the German shipbuilder's local subsidiary, declined to respond to the accusation. Mitsubishi Heavy Industry also said that it had no comment.A senior industry source who was involved in the Australian submarine bidding called the allegation an ""extraordinary"" attempt to deflect attention from DCNS' security shortcomings.""Clearly there's been a massive leak. And for the French to seek to blame either the Japanese or the Germans under some banner of 'economic warfare' is hysterical,"" he told Reuters.The French victory in one of the world's most valuable defence contracts was a major blow to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to develop defence export capabilities as part of a more muscular security agenda.Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne visited Tokyo this week to meet with her Japanese counterpart, Tomomi Inada, in the first such visit since the contract was awarded.DCNS and TKMS are currently locked in another competition for a lucrative contract to replace Norway's fleet of aging Ula-class submarines.

"Gold slid to a near five-week low on Monday after comments from top Federal Reserve officials fuelled speculation that U.S. interest rates would rise sooner rather than later, boosting the dollar.Speaking at a meeting of leading central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed chair Janet Yellen said on Friday that an improvement in the economy and the labour market in recent months had boosted the case for hiking rates.The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed the market pricing in more than a 30 percent chance of a hike in September, up from 18 percent before Yellen and her deputy Stanley Fischer spoke.Spot gold touched its lowest since July 26 at $1,314.70, and was down 0.1 percent at $1,319.81 an ounce at 1135 GMT. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $2.80 an ounce at $1,323.10.Gold whipsawed on Friday, rising as much as 1.5 percent in the immediate wake of Yellen's comments, before slipping back to end the day marginally lower.""The market was surprised (by Yellen) -- that is why it went all the way up first, before losing it all,"" Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland, said. ""The demand for physical (gold) is still very poor, so it feels like we may need to test lower levels first before a surge in price.""Gold's volatility tracked fluctuations in the dollar. The U.S. currency gave up gains soon after Yellen spoke as she gave no indication that a rate hike was imminent, but rebounded as traders reassessed her words, and after Fed Vice Chair Fischer said the Fed was still on track to lift rates this year.Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.""The pressure on gold will likely increase as we go into September, as participants are now more willing to bet on a rate hike given what they have gleaned from top Fed officials on Friday,"" INTL FCStone said in a note.Hedge funds and money managers increased their net long position in COMEX gold contracts in the week to Aug. 23, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.Silver was little changed at $18.61 an ounce, having earlier touched its lowest in more than eight weeks at $18.36 an ounce.Platinum, the biggest faller among the major precious metals last week, was up 1 percent at $1,077.60 an ounce, while palladium was down 0.2 percent at $684.38 an ounce.",business
"China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage.Ensuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be.Beijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said.""From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them,"" said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea.In recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington.While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media.China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders.State media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers.""Let's make cooperation ever higher,"" it wrote in a commentary last week.But the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.""Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules,"" the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary.""These new rules will exclude China.""ANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIAOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia.Australia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project.But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it.Joerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. ""It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies,"" Wuttke told Reuters.A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism.""The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence,"" the official added.None of this will make for plain sailing at G20.""China is angry with almost everyone at the moment,"" said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit.To be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat.""It's very important from the stance of national pride,"" said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics.""It's a minefield for China.""JAPAN WORRIESThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Last week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be ""constructive"" at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States.Wang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble.""Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case,"" Wang wrote.""Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.""",business

That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support.

They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.""It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,"" said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.""There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.""More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULAFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia.""Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,"" Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, said it is ""well-equipped for this niche market"".Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash.""The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,"" said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants.Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients.Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was ""not material"".MUSLIM VALUESCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.""Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,"" he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.""But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.""He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.""We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,"" he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)",business
"Reliance Industries unveiled its Jio telecom network on Thursday, touting free calls and rock-bottom data prices that sent shares of established telecom players into a nosedive on fears of an all-out price war.Reliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, told the energy group's annual shareholders' meeting that services on the Jio network would be available for free until Dec. 31 in a ""welcome offer"".Reliance, which has been giving freebies for the past few months as part of network testing, did not say when it would start billing customers.Reliance, one of India's biggest conglomerates which gets most of its revenue from its sprawling oil and gas business, has in recent years expanded into more consumer-facing markets such as retail and telecoms as growth slows in its core business.The company, which secured telecom airwaves in 2010, has so far invested more than $20 billion on building a nationwide network and has pledged to offer affordable services to price-conscious Indian customers.Ambani, who was interrupted by repeated rounds of applause as he took shareholders in a packed auditorium through Jio's ambitious rollout plans, free countrywide roaming offering and more, vowed to ""transform India from a high-priced data market to one with the lowest data rates anywhere in the world.""Jio could make Reliance a big provider of telecoms and internet services across India - a nation of 1 billion mobile phone subscribers - and is a key plank of Ambani's strategy, even though the business is unlikely to add significantly to group profits any time soon.Jio will effectively price 1 gigabyte of data at about 50 rupees on average, about one-fifth of what rivals charge, Reliance said in a statement.Ambani set a target of 100 million customers for Reliance Jio ""in the shortest possible time"", without specifying.PRICE WARShares in India's No. 1 wireless carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd dropped 6.3 percent while smaller rival Idea Cellular fell 10.5 percent, on fears that Jio's aggressive rates will trigger a price war. Incumbents have already started lowering data prices ahead of Jio's entry.Bharti Airtel said: ""We welcome Reliance Jios entry to the digital world and wish them the very best,"" but made no comment on the new entrant's price plans. Idea did not comment.Still, one telecom analyst with a foreign brokerage said Jio would face challenges in luring low-spending phone users to its network.Jio's cheapest of 10 plans starts at 149 rupees ($2.22) a month and offers just 0.3 gigabytes of data, while the next monthly plan costs 499 rupees for 4 GB of data. It will also offer a 299 rupee plan with 2 GB of data which has to be used in 21 days.By comparison, the monthly average revenue per user for India's telecoms industry, where many still use basic phones, was 127 rupees in the quarter ended March, according to latest data available with the sector regulator.""It is definitely aggressive and will hurt the incumbents,"" said the analyst who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.

"Crude prices rose on Friday after losses of more than 3 percent a day earlier, with investors treading cautiously ahead of key U.S. employment data that will help gauge the health of the world's largest economy and oil consumer.Brent crude had climbed 27 cents to $45.72 a barrel by 0426 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up 24 cents at $43.40 a barrel, buoyed by a weaker dollar.Though rising in this session, Brent and WTI are on track for their biggest weekly losses since mid-January, hit by oil inventory builds and weak U.S. manufacturing data.""Downward momentum is a feature of the oil market,"" said CMC Markets analyst Ric Spooner.""The end of the U.S. driving season and the prospect of building inventories create downward risk for the oil price and may see further pressure on energy stocks today.""Investors are looking ahead to non-farm payroll data later in the day for a sense of the direction of the U.S. economy, with a strong reading seen boosting the chance of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike soon.A rate rise may strengthen the U.S. dollar, which could depress oil prices as it would make the dollar-denominated commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies.Friday's oil price gains may be capped by concerns of slowing global economic growth. There is also growing scepticism among traders that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers such as Russia will agree to freeze production at a meeting in Algeria later this month.However, lending credence to a freeze, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, has appeared to change its stance and is likely to support production stabilization at the meeting.But further clouding the issue, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Friday played down the potential for talks on a possible output freeze.Additionally, more U.S. supply will return to the market as some producers in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico are restarting operations after Hurricane Hermine is set to make landfall.Manufacturing activities in parts of Asia, which accounts for most of the world's oil demand growth, has also slowed.""Most of Asia depends on exports, and without demand picking up in the west and on the mainland (of China), it's hard to see a sustained rebound in trade,"" HSBC economist Frederick Neumann said in a note.",business

"Spain has nominated as its World Bank representative a former industry minister who resigned following allegations of links to offshore dealings which emerged after he was named in the Panama Papers.The Economy Ministry said in an e-mailed statement late on Friday night that the Spanish government had proposed Jose Manuel Soria as executive director at the World Bank.Soria, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned as minister in April following reports of alleged links to an offshore company on the British island of Jersey in order to limit any damage to Spain's caretaker government, the conservative People's Party (PP).Soria's resignation came ahead of Spain's national election in June, its second in seven months, which ended as inconclusively as the previous one in December..The nomination was announced when acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy from the PP failed at the second attempt to win a new term, increasing the likelihood that Spain will have to hold its third election in year.In what could become another public embarrassment for the PP caretaker government, plagued by a string of corruption scandals, the opposition Socialists have said they will demand Economy Minister Luis de Guindos urgently appear in parliament to explain the reasons for the government's nomination.The PP has faced a slew of investigations over allegations of misappropriating public funds and influence peddling, which have seen several of its politicians resign. The PP has denied it has a problem with corruption, saying the cases are isolated and it is tackling them.The World Bank's 189 governors are expected to vote on Soria's candidature as part of the process of appointing 25 executive directors.The Spanish government examines the suitability of candidates based on their track record in public service as well as on their experience when selecting for international posts, the Economy Ministry said.",business

"KABUL: Tax-exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market, industry officials and a new anti-corruption report reveal, causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid.An AFP team witnessed first-hand evidence hinting at how duty-free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week.Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards, the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers, scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry.Among the documents from one driver was a ""maafinama"" -- a tax-exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around $200 a ton -- showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry.Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries -- responsible for Afghan military and police -- is exempted from custom duty, following a security agreement between the government and NATO.""What is this fuel doing in this market?"" asked the official, standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations.""Thats the big question,"" he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck, pledging a full investigation.He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasons- Misuse -No commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war-ravaged Afghanistan as fuel -- and none more at risk of being stolen, smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption, observers say.Last year, more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan, the finance ministry said, with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around $100 million.""The custom duty exemption mechanism... (for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit,"" said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain ""maafinamas"" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to ""misuse"".""Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies,"" the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.""(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.""NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFPs queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he ""cannot confirm nor deny"" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.- Contaminated -The comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label ""donor fatigue"" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.""Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market,"" said the official who carried out the inspection.""How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.""The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.""MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented,"" the MEC report said.""Why not? Is the reason for the delay perhaps another instance of corruption?""",business
"HANGZHOU, CHINA: The global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the open of a two-day summit of leaders from G20 nations.His warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U.S. president described as ""extremely productive"", but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea.With the summit taking place after Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U.S. presidential election in November, observers expect G20 leaders to mount a defense of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism.The global economy has arrived ""at a crucial juncture"", Xi said, in the face of sluggish demand, volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment.""Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading, while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum,"" he said.G20 countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures - including monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.""Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth,"" Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.Xi also called on G20 countries to match their words with actions.""We should turn the G20 group into an action team, instead of a talk shop,"" he said.But some of the G20 leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity.BATTLE LINESOn Sunday, Xi held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and told him he hoped Australia would continue to provide a fair, transparent and predictable policy environment for foreign investors.China was angered when Australia blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders last month.China has accused Australia of bowing to protectionist sentiment in blocking the bid for Ausgrid, as well as an earlier one by a China-led consortium to buy cattle company Kidman &amp; Co.Beijing has also criticized Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity, saying it was ""unacceptable"" the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years.""Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element,"" he told a news conference.Britain's future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion.Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain's closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her.But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal.Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union's common market, it needed to respect the rules of the common market.Turnbull, meanwhile, said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc.LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night.He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and stressed U.S. commitments to its regional allies.Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it.According to a ""fact sheet"" on China-U.S. relations issued on Sunday, the two sides agreed on a range of issues, including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers.Obama, now in the last five months of his presidency, is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific, setting the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office on Jan. 20.His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport, where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access. Obama said on Sunday he ""wouldn't over-crank the significance"" of the airport events.""None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship (with China),"" he told a news conference. ""The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation.""Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou, with parts of the city of 9 million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G20 summit stays incident-free.",business

"India will present proposals to the World Trade Organization on ways to ease trade in services, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday, as Asia's third-largest economy seeks to leverage one of its competitive strengths.India cleared the way for a WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement covering goods in 2014, after tortuous talks in which it won a concession letting it stockpile strategic food reserves for its mostly poor population of 1.3 billion people.New Delhi has often dragged its feet in the multilateral arena and been reluctant to cut bilateral free-trade deals because experience has shown its goods sector often cannot compete on international markets.By contrast, India's services sector, including back-office operations for multinationals, is a big export earner and the idea of striking a similar multilateral deal on services first came up at a meeting of trade ministers in Paris in June.""While there seems to be trade facilitation for goods, there doesn't seem to be trade facilitation for services, and that was a point I made in Paris,"" Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters at a business conference in New Delhi.""This is a matter on which the WTO will now have to work,"" said Sitharaman, speaking on the sidelines of the Economist India Summit.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for freer trade in services at the recent Group of 20 summit hosted by China and, Sitharaman said, India will soon submit a paper to the WTO as requested at the Paris meeting.Modi told the G20 grouping that a knowledge and innovation-driven economy required free movement of professional workers.Restrictions on the admission of Indian IT experts have been one area of concern between the United States and India, and figured in recent two-way strategic and commercial talks.",business
"The dollar took a tumble and Asian stocks rose to one-year highs on Wednesday after surprisingly weak U.S. services sector activity put paid to already slim chances of an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve as early as this month.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent, extending its chunky gains of 2.7 percent over the last two days, to claim a level last seen in July last year.""When people think there's no immediate rate hike from the Fed, then Asia and emerging markets are the place to go to, as investors seek yields,"" said Toru Nishihama, senior economist at Dai-ichi Life Research.Japan's Nikkei slid 0.7 percent, however, as the yen gained sharply versus the dollar, putting more pressure on exporters in the world's third-largest economy.The Institute for Supply Management's index of non-manufacturing activity fell to 51.4, its lowest level since February 2010, from 55.5 the month before and well shy of the 55 estimate.Given the strength in the service sector has been making up for softness in the manufacturing in the past year or so, the data was a blow to the case for the Fed to raise interest rates as soon as this month.""The Fed now looks certain to keep rates on hold this month,"" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economics strategy group at HSBC in Tokyo.Comments from several Fed officials in recent weeks had boosted bets on a rate hike in coming months, but investors have had to scale back their expectations since Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. payrolls report.San Francisco Fed president John Williams, speaking after the ISM data, also said he expects the Fed will raise rates gradually over the next few years.""Recent hawkish comments from Fed officials were probably intended to warn markets against being too complacent about the chance of a rate hike, rather than to make markets fully price in a rate hike,"" Shirota said.U.S. bond yields fell, with policy-sensitive two-year notes yield US2YT=RR falling to 0.730 percent, its lowest since Aug. 19, down from 0.853 percent marked on Aug. 29.U.S. interest rate futures price gained to indicate only about 15 percent chance of a rate hike this month and just over 50 percent even by December, compared to above 20 and 60 percent, respectively, before the data were released.Declining U.S. yields undermined the dollar against other currencies and precious metals. The dollar, which had slumped 1.38 percent on the yen on Tuesday, shed another 0.5 percent to 101.48 yen.The yen gained additional support from a media report that the Bank of Japan's board is struggling to agree on a common front in its planned policy review.The euro maintained Tuesday's 0.96 percent rise against the dollar, the biggest daily gain in three months on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1247.A resurgent British pound rose to near eight-week high of $1.3445 on Tuesday and held firm at $1.3416.Gold rallied to $1,352.4 per ounce to near three-week highs on Tuesday, and last stood at $1,350.0.The Australian dollar took a breather. It was last down 0.2 percent at $0.7668 after GDP data largely met expectations, with Australia's annual growth clocking its fastest pace in four years last quarter, clinching a remarkable run of 25 years without recession.Oil prices kept some distance from three-week lows touched last week, maintaining a part of gains made after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on Monday to cooperate in world oil markets, saying they will not act immediately but could limit output in the future.Brent crude futures stood at $47.49 per barrel LCOc1, up 0.5 percent on the day and above its low last week of $45.32.",business

Large airports are benefiting from capacity shifts where flights are being directed through major connecting hubs.But the trend toward hubs comes at the expense of smaller regional airports, which are losing out on traffic, Gittens noted.Air cargo grew more weakly than passenger traffic, rising 2.6 percent in total volume during 2015, partly because of subdued growth in emerging markets and developing economies.",business

"Crude prices fell over 1.5 percent on Monday after U.S. oil drillers added rigs to look for new production as producers adapt to cheaper crude, with speculators cutting positions betting on further price rises.Brent crude futures were trading at $47.29 per barrel at 0200 GMT, down 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 80 cents, or 1.74 percent, at $45.08 a barrel.Traders said the price falls on Monday and Friday were a result of increasing oil drilling activity in the United States, which indicated that producers can operate profitably around current levels.""Each dollar is being used far more efficiently and, as a result, $50 oil appears much more palatable,"" Barclays bank said in a note to clients.U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a tenth week in the past 11, according to a Baker Hughes rig count report on Friday.

"Authorities in the US are seeking as much as $14 billion from Deutsche Bank to resolve allegations stemming from the sale of mortgage securities in the 2008 crisis, the German financial giant confirmed Thursday.The payout would be the largest ever inflicted on a foreign bank in the United States, easily surpassing the $8.9 billion that the French bank BNP Paribas paid in 2014 for sanctions violations.But in a quick reaction, Deutsche Bank rejected the $14 billion figure, which the bank said was an opening proposal in settlement talks with US prosecutors.""Deutsche Bank has no intent to settle these potential civil claims anywhere near the number cited,"" the statement said.""The negotiations are only just beginning. The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.""The US investment bank Goldman Sachs in April agreed to pay more than $5 billion to settle similar allegations.US authorities have accused major banks of misleading investors about the values and quality of complex mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the underlying lending was worthless or fraudulent, delivering billions of dollars in losses to holders of the mortgage bonds when the housing market collapsed, bringing down numerous banks and touching off the countrys worst recession since the 1930s.According to securities filings, Deutsche Bank as of June 30 had set aside $5.5 billion to resolve pending legal matters. In the mortgage-backed securities matter, the bank is aiming for an amount between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to knowledgeable sources.The US Justice Department declined to comment.Bank of America in 2014 paid out nearly $17 billion in a related enforcement action but federal authorities have faced stinging criticism for failing to hold individuals to account.In recent years, Deutsche Bank has found itself mired litigation and enforcement actions around the world.US market regulators last year fined the German lender $55 million, concluding that it had overvalued its holdings of credit derivatives by at least $15 billion during the financial crisis.In 2015 and 2016 Deutsche Bank failed so-called stress tests conducted by the US central bank that were designed to determine whether it had adequate capital strength to weather shocks such as those of the financial crisis.In June, the International Monetary Fund described the bank as a ""major systemic risk,"" leaving its chief executive John Cryan to strive to convince markets that Deutsche Bank was bound to recover.In April of last year, Deutsche Bank also paid a record $2.5 billion to settle American and British charges that it had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, affecting commercial interest rates.The bank also settled with the US Fed and New Yorks Department of Financial Services of alleged sanctions violations in Syria and Iran.In July Deutsche Bank posted a 98 percent year-on-year drop in second-quarter profits, with net earnings recorded at only $22 million, which Cryan, the banks chief, attributed to ""sustained restructuring.""Cryan plans to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide by 2020, while the banks share price has fallen to around 10 percent of its pre-crisis value.",business

"SAN FRANCISCO/U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output, productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades.It would be the fourth time in 15 months that the U.S. central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so-called neutral rate was too optimistic, raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years.The Fed, however, still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth.Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer-run rate at this week's monetary policy meeting, with the median forecast possibly falling to 2.75 percent. It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the ""shallowest"" set of rate hikes ever; ""much flatter,"" according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.""They are not very far from being in a tightening mode,"" said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. ""That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.""FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.""They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after.

"JOHOR, MALAYSIA: Some 15 km (9 miles) from the bustling port of Singapore, a rusting tanker as big as the world's largest aircraft carriers lies idle in a muddy estuary flanked by mangrove trees on the coast of southern Malaysia.The 340-metre (1,115 ft) ""FPSO Opportunity"", a hulking so-called Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel capable of drilling for oil in deep waters, is currently surplus to requirements along with scores of other rigs, tankers and support vessels in an era of cheap oil.The fleet of mothballed giant vessels anchored around Southeast Asian waters is the physical fallout of an oil downturn heading into its third year, and a stark reminder of how badly the industry miscalculated market conditions.""There was a misguided focus? on scarcity in the supply side from the early 2000s,"" said David Fyfe, head of research at oil and commodity trading firm Gunvor.""As an industry, they were complacent. They thought because cost was high, prices will remain high ... (but) then there was the advent of shale. Since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.""The shale revolution turned the United States into one of the world's biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the Middle East and Russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices LCOc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.The FPSO Opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by Chevron CV.N and Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) before being taken over by a Bermuda-registered FPSO Opportunity Inc in 2011. The newest owner could not be reached for comment.NEW LANDSCAPEThe growing number of vessels anchored in the Johor river estuary is changing the landscape for the locals.""I've been coming here to fish every day for 10 years, and never have there been more ships parked,"" said an angler named Aiman, sitting on an unused pipeline lying on the beach.""It is quite intimidating to come here before dawn and to find, with the first rays of sun, another big ship has been parked here,"" he added, with his line dangling in the river.And it's not just Malaysia that has become the dumping ground for idled oil equipment.Across the Singapore Strait, in the bays of Indonesia's Batam island, over a hundred oil drilling and support vessels have been sitting idle for months, or even years.While laying up ships is legal and even provides profit to specialist mothballing companies, environmental groups say the growing number adds to the risk to flora and fauna.""The idling oil tankers risk polluting the marine environment, which a sizable population of the riverine fishermen rely on for their living,"" said Vincent Chow, chairman of the Malaysian Nature Society in Johor, citing the threat of dissolving paint and potential leakage of heavy metals and fuel into the sea.COST OF DOING NOTHINGThe armada of laid-up vessels shows how the shale boom caught the oil industry off guard and scuppered plans to drill for new fields.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said global exploration spending halved in 2015, while BMI Research sees capital expenditure among oil producers suffering another sharp decline this year.Struggling drilling companies are paying to lay up rigs in the hope they will survive until demand picks up again.The cost depends on size and location, and whether they are in a so-called ""hot lay-up"", whereby equipment is kept operational so the vessel quickly returns to service, or ""cold lay-up"" whereby ships can be mothballed for years.Cold lay-up for a rig or large oil tanker costs $20,000 to $25,000 a month in Johor, said Balasubramanian Krishna, operations manager at Malaysian lay-up specialist Ocean Shipcare, while laying-up a small supply vessel costs $3,000 to $4,000 a month.Matti Bargfried, head of marketing at maritime software company CODie, said a lay-up time of several years could make re-commissioning lengthy and costly.""The main concern here is preservation against humidity, leakage of chemicals and condition of the hull,"" he said.This means that some of the idled vessels may have to be scrapped in yards in countries such as India or Bangladesh, although shippers say the current cost of the journey may be more than their scrap value.",business

"India will accelerate its building of new hydropower plants along three rivers that flow into Pakistan, a source familiar with the plan said on Monday, in a move likely to aggravate already tense relations with its neighbour a week after an attack on an Indian army base.Disagreements over how to share the waters of the Indus and other rivers have dogged relations between the nuclear-armed arch-rivals since independence in 1947.The dispute looks set to be reignited after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told officials on Monday that India should use more of the rivers' resources, speaking a week after the Sept. 18 attack on an army base in the disputed region of Kashmir that New Delhi blames on Pakistan, a source with knowledge of the meeting attended by Modi said.India has vowed to respond to the raid, in which at least 18 of its soldiers were killed, but any military option risks escalation. Some officials have called for a renewed diplomatic offensive instead.Modi said on Saturday that India would mount a global campaign to isolate Pakistan, including through the United Nations, where Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj spoke on Monday.India has long accused Pakistan of backing militant groups operating in the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir, through which several of the countries' shared rivers flow.Pakistan denies the allegations and says India has not provided adequate proof to support its claims. A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Modi's hydropower plans.At Monday's meeting, Modi and officials discussed ways to increase exploitation of the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers but said they would not violate a long-standing water treaty between the countries in the process.""We want to see that all these (hydropower) projects are put on a really fast-track basis,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on the condition he was not named because of the sensitivity of the meeting.""Our entire approach was done to create an atmosphere of goodwill. But in this atmosphere, we want to exploit all our rights under the (Indus Water) treaty,"" the source said.The Indus Water Treaty was signed in 1960 in a bid to resolve disputes, but India's ambitious irrigation plans and construction of thousands of upstream dams has continued to annoy Pakistan, which depends on snow-fed Himalayan rivers for everything from drinking water to agriculture.India says its use of upstream water is strictly in line with the 1960 agreement.The potential for a military conflict between India and Pakistan over water has long worried observers.The neighbours have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.India currently generates about 3,000 megawatts of energy from hydropower plants along rivers in its portion of Kashmir, but believes the region has the potential to produce 18,000 megawatts, the source said.New Delhi will also review whether to restart construction of the Tulbul navigation project, which was suspended several years ago. The project proposes diverting water from one of the shared rivers to a city in Indian-administered Kashmir that could impact flows downstream, the source said.A spokesman for Modi's office declined to comment.",business

"The number of foreigners visiting Turkey plummeted nearly 38 percent in August, with tourism battered by the July failed coup and security concerns after attacks, statistics showed Thursday.The figures are the first to show visitor numbers for a full month after the attempted putsch which saw a rogue military faction try to oust President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from power and attempt to seize Istanbuls main international airport.Some 3.18 million visitors came to Turkey in August this year, down 37.96 percent on August 2015, the tourism ministry said in its latest release.June saw the sharpest drop of 40.86 percent compared with the previous year, while in July, the number of arrivals fell by 36.72 percent.The tourism industry had already been hit before the coup by a string of attacks this year including the triple suicide bombing at Istanbuls main airport in June which left 47 dead and was blamed on the Islamic State group.Last month, 57 people including 34 children were killed in a suicide bombing during a Kurdish wedding in the southern city of Gaziantep. IS was again blamed by Turkish authorities.The tourism industry last year was worth $35.1 billion in revenues and it accounts for 4.4 percent of GDP in Turkey.Despite normalising ties with Moscow in June and the lifting of travel sanctions this summer, visitor numbers to Turkey from Russia fell 83.63 percent last month compared with the previous year.In August 2015, the overall number of Russian visitors was nearly 640,000 but this years figure for August was under 105,000, in a devastating blow to tourism on Turkeys Mediterranean coast.However, the resumption of charter flights to Turkish resorts at the start of September could see a welcome rise in Russian visitors.Arrivals in August from the key tourism market of Germany were down 34.5 percent while arrivals from Iran -- an increasing source of tourism -- fell almost 32 percent.Saudi Arabia was the only key tourism market to see any growth with visitor numbers from the kingdom reversing the trend and doubling in August 2015.In its latest trading update Tuesday, British travel operator Thomas Cook Group said that there was strong demand for most destinations except Turkey.The operator saw a four percent slump in bookings because of Turkey where ""demand continues to be volatile"", Peter Fankhauser, the groups chief executive, said in a statement.",business

"ALGIERS: OPEC agreed on Wednesday modest oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with the group's leader Saudi Arabia softening its stance on arch-rival Iran amid mounting pressure from low oil prices.""OPEC made an exceptional decision today ... After two and a half years, OPEC reached consensus to manage the market,"" said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who had repeatedly clashed with Saudi Arabia during previous meetings.He and other ministers said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day. OPEC estimates its current output at 33.24 million bpd.""We have decided to decrease the production around 700,000 bpd,"" Zanganeh said.The move would effectively re-establish OPEC production ceilings abandoned a year ago.However, how much each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.Oil prices LCOc1 jumped more than 5 percent to trade above $48 per barrel as of 2015 GMT. Many traders said they were impressed OPEC had managed to reach a compromise after years of wrangling but others said they wanted to see the details.""This is the first OPEC deal in eight years! The cartel proved that it still matters even in the age of shale! This is the end of the production war' and OPEC claims victory,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group.Jeff Quigley, director of energy markets at Houston-based Stratas Advisors, said the market had yet to discover who would produce what: ""I want to hear from the mouth of the Iranian oil minister that hes not going to go back to pre-sanction levels. For the Saudis, it just goes against the conventional wisdom of what theyve been saying."".Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that Iran, Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce ""at maximum levels that make sense"" as part of any output limits.That represents a strategy shift for Riyadh, which had said it would reduce output to ease a global glut only if every other OPEC and non-OPEC producer followed suit. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year.The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post-sanctions environment, Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since 2014 and its economy could expand by almost 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of $98 billion last year, a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.OIL PRICE PRESSURESSaudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than 10.7 million bpd, on par with Russia and the United States. Together, the three largest global producers extract a third of the world's oil.Iran's production has been stagnant at 3.6 million bpd in the past three months, close to pre-sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than 4 million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in.Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years, forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year.""The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years..."" said Raza Agha, chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital. ""So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi.""However, with unemployment in double digits, Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery.Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations. But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to around 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of 3.6-3.7 million bpd.Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran's output was limited by sanctions. Minister Zanganeh has said Iran wanted an output cap of close to 4 million bpd. Saudi output drops in winter when it needs less fuel than during summer, when cooling requirements spike.",business

"Oil prices surged Thursday after the OPEC producers group surprised the market with a deal to slash output.At the end of six hours of negotiations and weeks of horse trading, OPEC announced the plan to cut production to a level of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.47 billion, bpd in August, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.The informal meeting was held on the sidelines of an IEA meeting in a bid to stabilise prices that have been battered by a stubborn supply glut since 2014.Oil prices soared by as much as six percent following the news and extended gains in Asian trade on Thursday although at a slower pace.At around 0100 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November was up 23 cents to $47.29 and Brent crude for November added 22 cents to $48.91 a barrel.The decision to cut output caught the market offguard.Market watchers had been pessimistic about a cut or a freeze after similar efforts fell apart in April due to disagreements between OPEC majors Saudi Arabia and Iran.Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst with IG Markets said the OPEC decision was the main impetus for the price surge but said details of the deal ""sound a bit fuzzy at the moment"".""There is the possibility that OPEC managed to commit to a weak deal at this meeting that may pave the way for a more comprehensive production cut at the November meeting,"" he said in a note, referring to OPECs formal meeting on November 30.""A more comprehensive deal from OPEC and Russia at the November meeting would easily clear the way for WTI oil to trade around US$55.""Nicholson also said official data showing a fall in the weekly US commercial crude inventories helped to boost the market.The US Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stocks in the worlds top oil consumer fell by 1.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of three million barrels.A decline in crude stocks signals stronger consumption and is positive for oil prices.""This has now been four straight weeks of back-to-back declines in crude oil inventories, which is also very supportive of the spot price,"" Nicholson said.",business

"Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend.An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.That position, and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG, have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year.That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday (1030 GMT).For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend.A 3-0 sweep, meanwhile, would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four-match series.Off-spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left-arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line-up.That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury, leaving his place in the team in jeopardy.OKeefes inclusion for his second test -- his first on home soil -- would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006.Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all-rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4-61 in Melbourne.While Darren Bravo, Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne, the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests.Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series, West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left-arm orthodox Jomel Warrican.",sports
"After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015, Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year -- restoring his country to the top of the test rankings.Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player.The 26-year-old scored a remarkable 2,369 runs across all three formats, rattling up 1,474 in tests alone at an average of 73.70 with six centuries.He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50-over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India, New Zealand and West Indies.Even in the Ashes defeat to England, the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year, he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords.Even before he was captain, though, Smith was always clear that team success came first.With Australia already 2-0 up in the three-match series, this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa.""Its a huge motivation, thats what we want to be, number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there,"" Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Saturday.""It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3-0. Its been a good summer for us so far, so wed like to finish on a high.""Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start, Februarys two-test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance.Australia beat the Black Caps 2-0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side, like many of the top test teams, have struggled to win series overseas in recent years.""Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment, I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on,"" Smith added.""Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand, but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are, hopefully we can have a lot of success over there.""Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed.""I felt pretty good last week, I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again,"" Smith said.""All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch.I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed.""Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good, so hopefully I can score a few more this week.",sports
" New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited-overs matches in New Zealand this month.Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one-day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa.The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five-year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing.He also served three months of a six month prison term.His ban, imposed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career.He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program, McCullum said.If he gets out on the field against us, then you play against the man you're playing against, not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster, added the explosive batsman.New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation.He was a very, very young man, a boy really (when he was suspended), White said.He showed remorse at the time, admitted to it. He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC.I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing, added White.New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received.A decision is likely next week.",sports
"Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow tore apart the South African bowling attack as they enjoyed a run feast at Newlands on a record-breaking second day of the second Test which led to England declaring their first innings on 629 for six.South Africa were 24 for one wicket in reply at tea with a 605-run deficit.Stokes amassed 258 runs and Bairstow an unbeaten 150 as they bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket Test record of 399 runs.Stokes notched up the quickest 250 (off 196 balls) in Test history after scoring the second fastest double century (163 balls) in a knock that lasted 198 deliveries, which included 30 fours and a England record 11 sixes.Bairstow notched an emotional first test century, with England declaring once he got to 150 off 191 balls with 18 fours and two sixes.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable one and half sessions of devastating batting before putting the dispirited-looking home side into bat.Stokes double century took 10 balls more than New Zealands Nathan Astle, who holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls. Englands previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.In reaching 250 off 196 balls, Stokes beat Virender Sehwags record and also set the highest score by a batsman at number six, beating a 39-year-old mark held by Australian Doug Walters.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs playing as if it was a Twenty20 match.They set the tone from the start of the second day with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century.Bairstow started the day on 39.Stokes eventually went out in something of an anti-climax as he skied a shot to AB de Villiers, who dropped a simple-looking catch only to sweep up the ball and hit the stumps to run out the batsman as he ambled back to the crease.South Africas horror day did not end after the declaration with Stiaan van Zyl run out for four in the third over of their first innings, setting off for a quick run but being sent back by opening partner Dean Elgar.Elgar (8) and captain Hashim Amla (10) were not out at tea with Elgar surviving a leg before wicket decision after a review showed he got the slightest of edges to the ball.

"Ben Stokes scored the second fastest double century in Tests and led a run feast on the second day of the second Test against South Africa by battering the home attack to take England to 513 for five wickets at lunch.Stokes (204 not out) and Jonny Bairstow, who was unbeaten on 95, bludgeoned a limp-looking home attack from the opening ball on Sunday, setting a new sixth-wicket record stand for England.The pair took the overnight score from 317 for five in a remarkable session that produced 196 runs in two hours of devastating batting.Stokes double century came off 163 balls with 26 fours and seven sixes.New Zealands Nathan Astle holds the record for the fastest double century in 153 balls while Englands previous fastest was by Ian Botham who took 220 balls.Stokes now holds the record score for an England number six, beating Graham Hicks 187 against India in 1993, and became the first English centurion at Newlands for 50 years.He produced an array of astonishing boundaries, bringing up his 200 by pulling Morne Morkel for a four and leaving the home side looking dispirited in the field on another hot day in Cape Town.England, already 1-0 up in the four-Test series after winning the first Test in Durban by 241 runs, went from 300 to 400 in 15 overs and 400 to 500 runs in just 11 overs.The tourists began Sundays play like they were playing a Twenty20 match with 45 runs in the first four overs as Stokes advanced from 74 not out overnight to his century and did not let up after that.Bairstow brought up his 50 soon after -- his fourth in five innings against South Africa -- as the pair picked up the pace with 102 runs in the first hours play.The South African bowling attack, without injured Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander, had their figures hammered with debutant Chris Morris going to lunch having conceded 141 runs for his single wicket.Kagiso Rabada was 3-123 and spinner Dane Piedt 0-112.

"Australias spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather-disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday.More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop-start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start.Denesh Ramdin, unbeaten on 23, and Carlos Brathwaite (35 not out) will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away.The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and OKeefe got plenty of turn off a straw-coloured wicket.Off-spinner Lyon (2-68) produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwoods off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85.Left-arm orthodox spinner OKeefe (1-42) then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil.Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne, West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test.After the early loss of opener Shai Hope (nine), Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo (33) looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one.Australias bowlers emerged from the break re-energised, however, and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravos miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep.That broke a 91-run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20-run mark.He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble, left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps.After a long glare at his partner, Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground.Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half-century just before lunch by clipping all-rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced. He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the openers glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip. (Reuters)",sports
"Captain Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century on the third day of the second Test against England and AB de Villiers made 88 as South Africa reached tea on 290 for three on Monday.Amla scored his first hundred for more than a year and De Villiers reached 8,000 Test runs before he pulled a short ball from Steven Finn to James Anderson at mid-wicket just before the interval.South Africa trailed the touring side by 339 runs, 140 short of avoiding the follow-on, with Amla on 132 not out and Faf du Plessis on 15.Amla and De Villiers resumed on 141 for two and extended their partnership to 183, giving South Africa a foothold in the game after England declared on a massive total of 629 for six on a second day of record-breaking batting.The experienced pair played with much circumspection but did offer chances.<br/> Amla was twice dropped -- by Joe Root on 76 and Nick Compton on 120 -- and De Villiers survived an lbw appeal after asking for a review, which showed he got a slight nick to a Ben Stokes delivery.De Villiers became the third South African batsman to pass 8,000 runs while Amla, who last made a significant contribution with 208 runs against the West Indies in December 2014, moved past 7,000 runs.The 31-year-old De Villiers joined Jacques Kallis (13,206) and Graeme Smith (9,253) on the list of South Africans with more than 8,000 Test runs.England, 1-0 up in the series, bowled good lines and with spells of aggression on a pitch that offered little assistance and in hot temperatures of over 30 degrees celsius.The third day, however, provided none of the fireworks of Sunday when Stokes and Jonny Bairstow smashed the ball to all corners of the picturesque ground.<br/> (Reuters)",sports
"Carlos Brathwaite shone briefly for West Indies but the rain was the only real winner on Monday as wet weather washed away all but 11.2 overs of play on the second day of the third Test against Australia.West Indies were 248 for seven in their first innings when the rain interrupted play for the third and final time half an hour after lunch in the wake of Brathwaites dismissal for 69.Play was officially abandoned at 4:35 p.m.(0535 GMT) as the rain continued to cascade down on Sydney Cricket Ground with the 14,266 optimistic souls who came through the gates despite the gloomy forecast offered a full refund.That meant that the flurry of boundaries with which Brathwaite lit up the few overs of action was ultimately a free show and the 27-year-old was warmly applauded for it by an appreciative crowd.Resuming on 35 with his team on 207 for six, the tall, muscular Bajan showed why he has been one of the few bright spots for West Indies on what has otherwise been a miserable tour.Playing his second Test after scoring 59 on debut in Melbourne last week, Brathwaite smashed four sixes and seven fours in his 71-ball innings.One of the two sixes he hit in one over off Australia paceman James Pattinson was a spectacular heave over the covers and deep into the crowd.A fuming Pattinson had his revenge, however, when he found his range and took out Brathwaites off stump with what the batsman described as a ""good nut"".""I was upset that once again I got a start and couldnt carry on. One of the main mantras in cricket is that when things are going good you maximize,"" Brathwaite said.""Then reaching halfway off and hearing the applause -- I even saw some people standing -- I just took a step back and said you know what, just enjoy the feeling. I raised my bat and looked around and it was a very, very good feeling.""Denesh Ramdin will resume on 30 not out for West Indies alongside Kemar Roach, who has yet to score, on day three.Only three balls were bowled in the first two hours of scheduled play and another 21 before lunch after the action resumed briefly at noon.Nearly three hours of play were lost to rain on day one of the match, a dead rubber after Australia racked up convincing victories in the first two Tests.

"Poor weather brought a limp end to a compelling second Test as England survived a final day onslaught from South Africa to draw the match and keep up their 1-0 lead in the series.England were 159 for six in their second innings, with Jonny Bairstow (30) and Moeen Ali (10) unbeaten, before drizzle and bad light halted play soon after tea on Wednesday.South Africas quick bowlers made inroads in the morning to offer the likelihood of a remarkable come-from-behind victory after England had dominated the opening two days to amass 629 for six declared in their first innings.South Africa clawed back over the next two days, keeping England in the field on hot, energy-sapping days as they slowly regained a foothold and eventually declared just two runs short of the visitors total.A four-wicket burst before lunch on Wednesday suddenly offered the tantalising possibility of a result and two more in the second session brought South Africa even closer to scuttling out England before chasing down a modest target.But dogged resistance from Bairstow and Ali, in an unbroken 43-run partnership, and the gloomy weather dashed South Africas hopes of pulling off a remarkable victory.England started the day on 16-0 in their second innings, with a lead of 18 runs, but captain Alastair Cook was strangled down the leg side and caught by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off Kagiso Rabadas bowling with just the eighth ball of the morning.He went for eight with England having added a single to their overnight total.Alex Hales (5) was then snagged by a brilliant diving one-handed catch from Chris Morris at slip to give Morne Morkel a deserved wicket after some fiery bowling.Joe Root was caught in the slips by AB de Villiers off Morkel on 17 but television replays showed the bowler had stepped over the line.But Englands top-ranked batsman failed to capitalise on the reprieve and scored 12 more runs before being bowled by Morris to leave England on 55-3.Nick Compton (15) fell 10 minutes before lunch after playing straight to Faf du Plessis at short mid-wicket as he became the first of three victims for Dane Piedt.After the interval, the off spinner dismissed Ben Stokes, caught at deep square leg for 26, and James Taylor, who got a nasty bounce up onto his gloves and was caught by Temba Bavuma at short leg for 27.The third Test will be at the Wanderers in Johannesburg from Jan.14-18.

Hes got a bit of pace to him so hopefully he can hurry up the Indian batters a bit.""Smith also said he hoped the WACA would be back to its traditionally fast and bouncy ways after it was widely criticised for being a batsmans paradise during the recent test series against New Zealand.Over 1,600 runs were piled on in the five-day draw, with six centuries scored.""It looks a little bit soft at the moment under foot,"" Smith said.""Its obviously a day out from the game. Well wait and see how it looks tomorrow.""But hopefully its got a bit more pace and bounce than the test match we played here.""I guess the WACA and Gabba have been a fortress for us in one-day and test cricket for a while.""Obviously its a bit different to what the Indians are used to back home.

"Lionel Messi reclaimed the FIFA Ballon d'Or award for the world player of the year on Monday from his great rival Cristiano Ronaldo who had walked off with the award for the previous two years.The Barcelona and Argentina forward took 41.33 percent of the votes followed by the Portuguese and Real Madrid forward (27.76 percent), with Brazil and Barcelona forward Neymar third (7.86 per cent).""It is a very special moment for me to be back here on this stage, winning again another Ballon dOr after being there in the audience watching Cristiano win,"" said Messi as he accepted the award at the end of a drawn-out 90-minute ceremony.""Its incredible this is my fifth.""Barcelona's Luis Enrique was voted coach of the year while United States World Cup winner Carli Lloyd, who scored a hat-trick in the final against Japan, was named women's player of the year.Initially started as the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1991, it became known as the Ballon d'Or after merging with France Football's European footballer of the year award in 2010.The award, shared exclusively between Messi and Real Madrid's Ronaldo since Brazilian Kaka won in 2007, has been heavily promoted by FIFA and was broadcast to 190 countries with 1,100 guests including players and coaches attending the ceremony.But it is not everyone's cup of tea and some critics, such as Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, say it is not appropriate in a team sport.""Im a big enemy of the Ballon dOr. Who will win it? You know as well as I do that its certainly Messi who will win it. I think so. Overall Im not a big fan of that,"" the Frenchman said earlier on Monday.The breakdown presented by FIFA also revealed tactical voting among the 165 national team coaches, 162 national team captains and 171 media representatives who cast votes.Messi, eligible to vote as Argentina captain, named Barcelona team mates Luis Suarez, Neymar and Andres Iniesta as his top three.Portugal captain Ronaldo choose three Real Madrid team mates -- Karim Benzema, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale.Belgium captain Vincent Kompany opted for his compatriots Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne as his top two.More surprisingly, Spain captain Iker Casillas -- the former Real Madrid goalkeeper who now plays for Portuguese club Porto -- was among those who did not vote.Despite a red carpet and plenty of glitz, the event had a low-key air of predictability about it and was held against the backdrop of FIFA going through the worst corruption crisis since it was founded in 1904.The sport is facing criminal investigations in both Switzerland and the United States, where some leading FIFA officials are among 41 individuals and sports entities who have been indicted on corruption charges.Outgoing FIFA president Sepp Blatter, normally a central figure in the ceremony, was not involved after being banned for eight years by the Ethics Committee in December and there was no President's Award, usually given out by Blatter for outstanding services to the game.Past recipients have included Pele, former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, the Haiti national team, Queen Rania of Jordan and South African anti-apartheid activist and veteran cleric, Archbishop Desmond Tutu.Acting president Issa Hayatou played a low-key role, reading a brief speech before the start and appearing on stage when the awards for best player and women's player were presented.Ronaldo said the players did not want to discuss FIFA's problems.""We avoid answering this kind of question,"" he told a press conference before the ceremony.""We are professional football players, we compete every week, every day, we train and we just focus on that. These things happen not just in football but in life, and the best thing would be no corruption anywhere.""In terms of individual achievement, Ronaldo had slightly the better in the last year, scoring 54 goals in 52 games for Real Madrid, compared to Messi's 48 in 53.",sports

He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza, one of his three scalps, as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168-run chase in the ninth over.Soumya Sarkar also made 43, but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over. Yet, Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries - they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings. Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half, until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2-0 lead in the four-match series.Bangladesh started well, but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over. But just as he started to rev up his engine, he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over.Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir. But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43.Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah, who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami. Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir.Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well, even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20-ball 24 before hobbling off the field. Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs.Masakadza came out all guns blazing, hitting two fours and two sixes in 2.2 overs, while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act. Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza. First, the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover, before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket.But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17. It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball, and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long-on for a 28-ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes. Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs. Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami, who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket.Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th, 14th and 15th over, but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners. Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21-ball 29 by Al-Amin Hossain in the 16th over.Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe. The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir, who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20.With a series win out of the equation, Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20.

"Glenn Maxwell struck a scintillating 96 in a tricky chase to help Australia beat India by three wickets in the third one-dayer on Sunday and take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.Maxwell revived Australias chase for a 296-run victory target with a spectacular knock and by the time he was dismissed after an 83-ball blitz, scores were tied at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.""It was nice to get a few out of the middle,"" the 27-year-old said at the presentation ceremony. ""I broke my number one bat which was a bit annoying. I have to call Kookaburra and try and get another one from them.""Virat Kohli had earlier struck a run-a-ball 117 to power India to a competitive 295 for six but the total was not enough in the end.Put into bat, India suffered an early setback as the law of average caught up with opener Rohit Sharma who, after centuries in the last two matches, fell for six in the fifth over.However, Shikhar Dhawan (68), now a Melbourne resident, batted himself back into form, raising 119 runs with Kohli before exposing his leg-stump which was pegged back by a John Hastings delivery.At the other end, Kohli became the fastest to score 7,000-runs in one-dayers, taking five less than the 166 innings South African AB de Villiers needed to reach the mark.The Indian test skipper found an able ally in Ajinkya Rahane (50), who notched up his second successive fifty, as the duo added 109 runs.Hastings, who finished with a career-best 4-58, ended Kohlis sparkling knock of 117 that included two sixes and seven boundaries.Dropped on 20, Aaron Finch (21) could not make the most of the reprieve but Shaun Marsh (62) and skipper Steven Smith (41) added 64 runs to steady the Australia reply.At 215-6, the hosts looked in trouble before Maxwell bailed them out with some uninhibited stroke-making.Needing 65 runs off the last 10 overs, Maxwell hit Umesh Yadav for a six and a four in the 43rd over that produced 15 runs and proved the turning point in the thrilling contest.Maxwell missed his second ODI ton but belted three sixes and eight boundaries in his stellar knock to claim the man-of-the-match award as the hosts romped home with seven balls to spare.The teams now move to Canberra for the fourth one-dayer on Wednesday.

"HAMILTON: Skipper Kane Williamson and fellow opener Martin Guptill forged the highest partnership in Twenty20 Internationals to secure New Zealand a series-levelling 10-wicket victory against Pakistan in the second match in Hamilton on Sunday.The 171-run stand between the pair, who shared the man-of-the-match award, bettered the previous record of 170 between South African openers Graeme Smith and Loots Bosman against England in a 2009 match at Centurion.Opting to bat first, Pakistan posted 168 for seven in 20 overs with Umar Akmal (56 not out) and Shoaib Malik (39) scoring the bulk of the runs in the second match of the three-game series.Akmal needed 22 balls for his fifty and hit four sixes as Pakistan settled for a score their bowlers eventually could not defend.The tourists struggled to come to terms with the contrasting batting styles of New Zealands opening pair who milked the Pakistan attack with consummate ease.Williamson hit 11 boundaries to remain unbeaten on 72 as his team sealed victory with 14 balls to spare.Guptill faced 10 more balls for his 87 not out, hitting four sixes and nine boundaries, the last of which sealed victory and created a new partnership record.Wellington hosts the decider on Friday.

"Big financial incentives for gamblers, small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one-on-one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match-fixers, according to experts and industry insiders.Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match-fixing, just as the Australian Open, the first grand slam tournament of the year, kicked off in Melbourne.Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport, where, out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world, the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove.Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents, said Steve Georgakis, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, who is researching match-fixing in tennis.""If you have a look at the big tournaments, the Opens or Olympic Games, youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins,"" he said.But at a small tournament the following week, how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured, said Georgakis.A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds-on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player, handing a big payoff to those behind the fix.""Its a one-on-one sport and what you do is, youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match.And you can never get caught,"" Georgakis added.Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites, and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually, Patrick Jay, an independent betting expert, told the United Nations in 2015.In that sea of money, tennis is the second most active betting market, trailing only soccer, research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows.Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs, a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity.Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point-by-point or game-by-game with limits on those types of bets, pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match.""Say you want to throw a game but win the match, why would you bother? You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars,"" the gambler said.Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit, which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis.But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act.""Most money is won by betting on the favourite, which is not a good result for bookmakers,"" he added.""But if hes up one set to love and then, in play, people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot, most likely, to say (to the authorities) is there anything you need for us to look into?,"" the bookmaker said.",sports
"Johanna Konta did not have to wait long after her stunning first round upset of Venus Williams at the Australian Open on Tuesday before having to field the inevitable questions about her national allegiance.Born and raised until her early teens in Sydney, the 24-year-old world number 47 moved to Britain in 2005 and plays under the flag of her adopted home.That background was not about to escape the attention of the local media, particularly after the impressive nature of her 6-4 6-2 win over the seven-times grand slam champion and former world number one.Asked whether she might consider switching her allegiance back to Australia, Konta was blunt. ""No,"" she said.""Unfortunately, my home is Great Britain. It has been for a long time now, over a decade. Yeah, no, thats where my heart is.""Ah, jealousy is not a good thing,"" she grinned, as the questioner pursued the point by contrasting her victory with former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosurs first round exit.""I think Australian tennis is doing quite well, to be honest.""You have a number of very good players, and its -- whats the word? Its not a privilege, but its a compliment that you guys would say that, so thank you. But be grateful for what you guys have.""Apart from the local verbal tick of beginning her answers with a ""yeah, no"", Konta has gained more obvious benefits from her time in Australia.""My ability to deal with the heat,"" she said. ""I think Im very lucky that I got to spend a lot of my young years here, because I got obviously exposed to the heat out here.""That was particularly beneficial on Tuesday when temperatures crept towards the 30 degrees Celsius mark on Rod Laver Arena.Because of her nationality switch, Konta is unlikely to be back on the main show court for her second round encounter with Carina Witthoeft or Zheng Saisai.

"Fernando Verdasco sent shockwaves through the Australian Open on Tuesday by defeating Rafael Nadal 7-6(6) 4-6 3-6 7-6(4) 6-2 to send the former world number one crashing out in the opening round.The first-round exit was the 2009 champion's first at Melbourne Park and only his second at such an early stage in a grand slam.Down 2-0 in the final set, world number 45 Verdasco dragged himself off the canvas with a barrage of booming forehand winners, breaking Nadal twice to move to the brink of victory.He then broke his compatriot a third time, sealing the four hour and 41-minute classic with a cross-court winner that left the Rod Laver Arena crowd stunned late in the day session.""I just hit everything. I think I played unbelievable in the fifth set from the break,"" Verdasco said in a courtside interview.""I just started hitting winners. I don't know how. I was closing the eyes and everything when I was coming in.""I kept doing it so it went well.""After shaking hands with his opponent and the chair umpire Nadal strode quickly off the court, barely pausing to acknowledge the crowd with a wave.The only other time Nadal was beaten so early in a grand slam was when Steve Darcis sent him crashing out of Wimbledon in 2013.""The match is five sets... he was playing amazing in the last set,"" Nadal told reporters. ""He had a lot of success all the balls hitting full power in the fifth.""'HAPPY FEELINGS'Before the tournament, Nadal had spoken of bringing ""happy feelings"" to Melbourne Park, after arriving his healthiest in years following a taxing off-season training camp.But his exit will do little to dispel the belief that the 14-times grand slam champion's best days are behind him.Nadal failed to progress further than the quarter-final of any of the grand slams last season, his first without a major trophy since 2004.Verdasco was inspired, however, hauling himself back from the brink with a stand-and-deliver game that mixed 90 winners with 91 unforced errors.It was partial revenge for his loss in an epic five-set semi-final against Nadal in the 2009 tournament, the second longest match recorded at the Australian Open.The 32-year-old served masterfully in each tiebreak, particularly in the second to keep the match alive, but wobbled early in the fifth when he was broken early.Fortune often plays a part in the defeat of Nadal and so it proved for Verdasco, who swung wildly at a second serve with the frame of his racquet, sending the ball cross-court to clip the line and break back to 2-2.He raised his hands in apology before acing Nadal to nudge ahead and ramped up the aggression on his more fancied opponent's serve.The pressure told on Nadal, who made his sixth double-fault to concede a break point, and Verdasco outfoxed the Spaniard in a fierce baseline rally to capture the decisive break.A raging ball of fire, Verdasco roared on to complete one of his finest victories and land a hammer blow on Nadal's early season confidence.""It's tough especially because it's not like (it) was here last year,"" added Nadal, who was beaten by Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals a year ago.""This year was a completely different story -- I had been playing and practising great and working so much, so it's tough when you work so much and you arrive at a very important event and you go out so early.""",sports
"FIFA's Sepp Blatter may have been banned for eight years from the game but he is still receiving his president's salary from world soccer's governing body, a spokesman for FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee told Reuters on Monday.Blatter was suspended for 90 days by FIFA on Oct 8 and then banned from the game for eight years last month for ethics violations over a $2 million payment FIFA made to European soccer boss Michel Platini with Blatter's approval in 2011.But Blatter, a Swiss national who has been president of FIFA since 1998, will continue to be paid until a new president is elected on Feb 26, the spokesman Andreas Bantel said. That would mean Blatter would have been paid for nearly five months during which time he was unable to carry out his duties, and a period in which FIFA has appointed an acting president, African soccer head Issa Hayatou.The compensation sub-committee of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee recently ruled that it could stop Blatter's bonuses but not, according to his contract, his salary.""Until the election of a new president on February 26, Mr Blatter is the elected president and therefore - according to his contract - is entitled to receive his remuneration,"" Bantel said.Blatter's U.S. lawyer and his Switzerland-based spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment.FIFA is facing the worst corruption crisis in it history as a total of 41 individuals and entities, including many former FIFA officials, have been charged with corruption-related offences in the United States. The U.S. investigation is far from over and FIFA also faces a parallel Swiss probe.Blatter's bonuses have been stopped because he was not carrying out his duties of supervising the organization, including its general secretary.Only last week, FIFA announced that Jerome Valcke was fired from his position as general secretary.

S.

"Australia win run-fest after India meltdownCANBERRA: Paceman Kane Richardson claimed his maiden five-wicket haul to script Indias spectacular collapse and bowl Australia to a 25-run victory in the high-scoring fourth one day international on Wednesday.Three batsmen struck centuries in the 671-run match between the worlds top two one-day teams but it was Richardsons (5-68) incisive bowling that clinched the contest, while also earning him the man-of-the-match award.Chasing 349 for victory, India were cruising at 277 for one before losing their last nine wickets for 46 runs to succumb to their fourth successive defeat in the five-match series.Opener Shikhar Dhawan (126) and Virat Kohli (106) featured in a 212-run stand for the visitors before the wheels came off Indias chase at Canberras Manuka Oval.Dhawan registered his ninth ODI century and Kohli scored his second consecutive hundred but India lost three wickets in 11 balls for the addition of one run that derailed them.For them, in-form Ajinkya Rahane came out to bat despite a split webbing of his fingers, but could score only two as India were all out for 323 in the final over.Earlier, Aaron Finch struck his seventh hundred in a blistering opening partnership of 187 with David Warner to power Australia to 348 for eight wickets.Finch smashed a run-a-ball 107 while Warner fell on 93 from 92 deliveries as the hosts continued to make merry against Indias toothless bowling attack after opting to bat first.Australia had chased down each Indian target to take an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series and the tourists battered bowlers did little better after finally getting the chance to bowl first.Warner, who missed the last two matches due to the birth of his second child, started off with a maiden against Umesh Yadav but soon hit his stride with three fours in an over against seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar.Yadav also conceded three boundaries in the next over against the diminutive left-hander as Australia raced to 50 in the seventh over.Finch was equally destructive and a fierce straight drive from the right-hander off fast bowler Ishant Sharma (4-77) hit umpire Richard Kettleborough on the shin, forcing the official off the field.Finch mistimed a pull to be dismissed eight overs after Warner had played Ishant on to his stumps while attempting a slog over mid-wicket.Australia captain Steven Smith (51) and all-rounders Mitchell Marsh (33) and Glenn Maxwell (41) chipped in with some quick runs.Sydney hosts the fifth and final one-dayer on Saturday.

"Stephen Cook became the 100th batsman to score a debut Test century and his innings of 115 helped South Africa amass 329 for five on the first day of the final Test against England on Friday in their bid to salvage pride in a lost series.Hashim Amla scored his 25th Test century as he and Cook shared a second-wicket stand of 202 but captain AB de Villiers departed second ball on a day of contrasting fortunes as England, 2-0 up in the four-Test series, fought back to claim four wickets after tea.Temba Bavuma (32) and Quinton de Kock (25) were not out at the close of play at Centurion Park.Handed his debut at the age of 33, one of five South Africa changes from the team badly beaten in the third Test in Johannesburg last week, Cook brought his domestic form to the test arena with a dream start to his international career.He survived two dropped catches, two close run-out calls and an lbw appeal unsuccessfully reviewed by England before reaching three figures -- a nervous spell in the 90s exacerbated by the departures of Amla and De Villiers.But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball on his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised from the start, hitting a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side.He should have been out on 47 but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broads bowling. He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures, scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes.De Villiers, captain for his second Test, was out for his second duck in successive innings, caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series.JP Duminy was Moeen Alis second wicket, trapped lbw for 16 -- the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africas progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one.

"Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century and Stephen Cook was 91 not out to lead South Africa to 224 for one at tea on the first day of the final Test against England as the hosts bid to salvage pride in a lost series.Amlas 25th Test century came off 131 balls in a confident display which brought him 18 fours while Cook was nine runs short of a debut Test century at Centurion Park on Friday.Amla, who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting, looked effortless as he raced to three figures to cheers South Africa who lost two of the first three Tests and the series.He was 102 not out at the interval.Cook, handed his debut at the age of 33 in one of five South Africa changes after defeat in Johannesburg last week, offered a straightforward chance after lunch when he got a healthy edge to a Stuart Broad delivery but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow on 47.There was another more difficult opportunity for Bairstow down the leg side when Cook was on 76. But Cook, whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39, looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition.He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side.Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch.Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf, allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground.Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali, hitting with some power, and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire.It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor, thriving in the most dangerous position on the field.South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket.Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg-side or pitched too short.

"KHULNA: First it was Hamilton Masakadza, who scored a record-breaking 93 to help Zimbabwe post a formidable total. Then came Tendai Chisoro's three-wicket haul that applied the brakes on Bangladesh's chase of 181 as the visitors levelled the series at 2-2 with an 18-run win in Khulna.While Chisoro picked up the key wickets of Sabbir Rahman and Shakib Al Hasan, and Mahmudullah, Neville Madziva, the pacer, did the damage at the start and towards the end as Bangladesh were bowled out for 162 in 19 overs to lose by 18 runs.Bangladesh's chase started badly as the top four were blown away with just 17 on the board. Mahmudullah and Imrul Kayes tried to resurrect the innings; Kayes slamming two fours and a six to briefly get the crowd going. But an attempted hoick over deep midwicket brought an end to his innings for a 14-ball 18 in the seventh over.Mahmudullah, meanwhile, rode luck found boundaries through edges and clips, but he soon got into his zone by hammering sixes over deep midwicket and long-off. Along the way, he was also a recipient of a huge slice of luck when he was dropped by Vusi Sibanda on 13.Nurul Hasan and Mahmudullah added 57 runs in 6.3 overs as the scales started to tilt again. But Sikander Raza revived Zimbabwe's hopes as he had Nurul, who was caught at cover. Mashrafe Mortaza, who has shown ability to wield the long handle, struck him for a four and six in the same over to reduce the equation down to 60 off the last six overs.A hint of panic endured as Elton Chigumbura threw the ball to his frontline spinner Graeme Cremer. Panic turned into proper nerves as he too was tonked for six by Mashrafe. But one slog too many resulted in Mahmudullah's downfall at the other end as he missed a full ball from Chisoro. Abu Hider Rony swung his way around, but he his effort had to be consigned to being scant consolation for the hosts. He was the last man to fall as Luke Jongwe held on to a low catch at cover to complete the win.The game started differently for Zimbabwe as they lost an early wicket, but Richmond Mutumbami and Masakadza got them up and running with a brisk 80-run stand. Mutumbami was also reprieved by Taskin Ahmed at short fine leg to add to Bangladesh's woes.Masakadza brought out his entire range of strokes, using a combination of brute force and timing to negotiate Bangladesh's spinners on a slow deck. He too was reprieved on 36 as the hosts suddenly went off the boil. Despite dismissing Mutumbami for a 25-ball 32, Bangladesh didn't look like getting control as Malcolm Waller blasted his way to an 18-ball 36 to strengthen Zimbabwe's base.On the night, the final flourish proved enough as Zimbabwe ran away emphatic winners as they restored parity to head into the World T20 with some confidence restored following a demoralising limited-overs series loss to Afghanistan earlier in the month. The jewel in Zimbabwe's twin wins to cap off their tour was Masakadza, whose 222 runs is a world record for most runs in aT20 bilateral series.",sports

"Manish Pandey struck his maiden one-day century in a high-scoring thriller to secure India a pride-salvaging six-wicket victory against Australia in the fifth and final ODI in Sydney on Saturday.Staring at a series whitewash after four defeats, India rode Pandeys scintillating 104 off 81 balls to chase down a 331-run victory target with two balls to spare.Centuries from David Warner (122) and Mitchell Marsh (102) helped Australia post 330-7 but Pandeys knock in his only fourth one-dayer clinched the contest for India.India needed a strong start from their openers to stay on course to chase down such a big total and the visitors got just that from Shikhar Dhawan (78) and Rohit Sharma (99).Dhawan posted his third successive 50-plus score and Rohit fell agonisingly short of his third century in the series as they raised 123 runs in 18.2 overs.John Hastings dismissed Dhawan and Virat Kohli (eight) in quick successions to halt Indias progress and Rohit left leaving India needing exactly 100 runs from 91 balls to win the contest.With the required run-rate skyrocketing and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (34) struggling to time the ball at the other end, Pandeys crisp hitting left India needing 13 runs off the last over from Marsh.Marsh began with a wide and had his next hit out of the ground by Dhoni but the Indian captain fell immediately to inject fresh drama in the contest.Pandey, however, was unfazed and he hit the next ball for a boundary to first complete his century and then scurried for two for the winning run.Earlier, Warner struck his fifth ODI century and Mitchell Marsh notched up his first to set up yet another runfest in a series that has provided 3,159 runs.Indias much-maligned bowlers did well to reduce Australia to 117-4 in the 22nd over before Warner and Marsh combined to add 118 runs in 17.3 overs.Warner had fallen seven runs short of a century in Wednesdays fourth ODI at Canberra but there was no such heartbreak this time as the southpaw brought up his run-a-ball century.The 27-year-old opener was eventually dismissed for 122, that included thee sixes and nine boundaries, but Marsh carried on to remain not out on 102 off 84 balls.For India, Jasprit Bumrah made an impressive debut, the right-arm paceman with an unorthodox bowling action sending down 10 tidy overs to claim 2-40 with some tight death bowling.Pandey was adjudged man-of-the-match, while team mate Rohit won the man-of-the-series award for the 441 runs he amassed in five matches.

"West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has officially retired from international cricket, seven months after selectors opted to discard the veteran and push for a youth-oriented policy.Chanderpaul, who was dumped before the home series against Australia last June, said at the time he felt he deserved the opportunity to play one final series despite a poor return in domestic cricket before the squad was selected.The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) thanked him for his contribution to their game.""The WICB acknowledges the invaluable contribution Shiv has made to the game globally and we wish him all the best,"" WICB President Dave Cameron said in a statement.The 41-year-old made his test debut against England in 1994 and went on to amass 11,867 runs at an average of 51.37 in his 164 tests for the Caribbean side.His total is the seventh highest of all time, and he finished behind Brian Laras 11,953 as the second most prolific West Indian batsman.He scored 30 test centuries and 66 half centuries and had a high score of 203 not out.He also scored 8,778 runs in 268 one-day internationals at 41.60.Chanderpauls ungainly batting stance was at odds with crickets coaching manuals, but soft hands and a superb eye allowed him to flick, dab and poke the ball into gaps in the field and quietly accumulate runs.A low conversion rate of 50s to 100s early in his career was rectified after foot surgery removed some floating bone chips and allowed him to play without pain.Chanderpauls calm demeanour held together an increasingly brittle West Indies batting lineup after the retirement of Lara and many opposition teams targeted him as the key wicket.While selectors continue to pursue their youth policy in a bid to rebuild the once powerful cricketing side, Chanderpaul was still playing domestic first class cricket earlier this week.",sports

"Anna-Lena Friedsams giant-killing run at the Australian Open ended in tears and injury on Sunday when ailments to both legs allowed world number four Agnieszka Radwanska to snatch a 6-7 (6) 6-1 7-5 fourth round win.The 21-year-old German, who had never been past the second round of a grand slam before this years tournament, had Radwanska on the ropes when she led 5-2 in the deciding set before injury cruelly struck at 5-4.The 82nd-ranked Friedsam, who beat U.S. Open finalist Roberta Vinci in the third round, then took an injury time out and had strapping applied to her left leg.Radwanska held serve in the next game, but Friedsam appeared to exacerbate her injury.The German was given a time warning on the first point of the next game when she was unable to serve and broke into tears.She managed to play on and was 15-40 down when she appeared to strain her right hamstring.Chair umpire Felix Torralba then sanctioned her again for exceeding the time limit and awarded Radwanska a point that sealed the game and gave her a 6-5 advantage.The trainer again visited Friedman, who was in constant tears on her chair, but she managed to hobble out and complete the match and was given a massive cheer by the Hisense Arena crowd for her efforts.Radwanska will now meet Spains Carla Suarez-Navarro, who beat Australias Daria Gavrilova 0-6 6-3 6-2, in the last eight.The Pole, who had to play through the pain of a leg injury in the third round, said she had felt a twinge of sympathy for her hobbled opponent but also needed to be ruthless to advance.""Of course, its hard to see that,"" said Radwanska, a semi-finalist at Melbourne Park in 2014.""Its tough because you know someone is struggling. But you really have to play your game because someone is still fighting./> ""I had no choice, just to fight till the end for each point. (Reuters)",sports
"South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada struck three times shortly before lunch to leave England teetering on 211 for six wickets on the third day of the fourth Test at Centurion Park on Sunday.Rabada removed Englands rock Joe Root (76), James Taylor (14) and Jonny Bairstow (0) with the tourists trailing by 264 runs after South Africa posted a first innings total of 475 on a wicket that is starting to favour the bowlers.In-form Ben Stokes (one) and Moeen Ali (zero) will seek to repair the damage after the interval with the first target to score the 65 runs required to avoid the follow-on.Rabada went to the interval with figures of 5-76, another sign of the rich potential of the 20-year-old who got movement at pace off the wicket to leave his side in control.Captain Alastair Cook (76) was the first wicket to fall in the opening session of the day when he was caught behind by wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock off the bowling of tall fast bowler Morne Morkel.Coming around the wicket to the left-hander, Morkel angled the ball into Cooks body and induced an edge as it moved away slightly off the wicket.It left Cook still 41 runs shy of becoming the first England batsman to reach 10,000 test runs after he had put on 99 for the third wicket with Root.Root and Taylor moved the score on to 208 before the former was caught by De Kock having a drive at Rabada after he had brought up his fourth half-century of the series.That wicket started a precession in the minutes before lunch as Taylor fell to the same combination trying to pull a short ball.South Africas successful morning was complete when Bairstow got a feather edge through to De Kock as a rampant Rabada tore through the middle-order.

"Firebrand fast bowler Kagiso Rabada bagged two wickets as South Africa reduced England to 52 for three at the close of day four of the final Test on Monday.The tourists, who have already won the series, need a further 330 for what would be a record-breaking victory on the final day but must do so on a wicket showing variable bounce and prodigious turn at Centurion Park.Englands hopes of an unlikely victory or survival will rest on Joe Root (19 not out) who is at the crease with James Taylor (19 not out) after Rabada gave the hosts the perfect start.The 20-year-old forced another failure from opener Alex Hales who was trapped lbw for one by a ball that kept low and jagged into him.Rabada claimed his ninth wicket of the match when he had Nick Compton (six) caught behind, the England batsman unsuccessfully reviewing what seemed an obvious edge.With a tense final day likely, England will hope that wasted review does not come back to haunt them.In between, Morne Morkel grabbed the prize scalp of England captain Alastair Cook (five) with a brilliant one-handed caught and bowled to leave the latter still 36 runs short of 10,000 test runs after a poor series.South Africa should have celebrated the wicket of Root as well, but wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock failed to take the ball after spinner Dane Piedt had drawn the batsman from his crease and beaten the edge.South Africa earlier declared their second innings on 248 for five.Hashim Amla fell four short of a second century in the match when he uncharacteristically flashed wildly at a wide deliver from Stuart Broad in the pursuit of quick runs.Amla added 117 for the fifth wicket with Temba Bavuma (78 not out), who showed great application and maturity.The highest successful chase in test matches at Centurion Park is 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Thunderstorms are forecast in Pretoria on Tuesday, though those will likely come late in the afternoon.

"MELBOURNE -- A year after her finest Grand Slam to date, Madison Keys left this year's Australian Open in tears.Playing on an injured left leg, Keys fell to Zhang Shuai 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the fourth round in Melbourne.In the second set, Keys began hobbling noticeably and called for treatment. She was unable to engage in long rallies and grimaced between points.With speculation she might retire, No. 15 Keys returned to the court, but the pain only seemed to increase. Already down a break, Keys doubled-faulted two times in a row, handing her Chinese opponent the set.Keys limped to her changeover chair, understandably frustrated, but this time did not call a trainer.Somehow, she managed to go up an early break at 2-1 in the third on a crushing 91 mph forehand return but was immediately broken back.After a quick hold from Zhang, a qualifier, Keys took another medical timeout. In the next game, she was visibly crying in pain. At that point, Keys could hardly move, lunging at shots just out of her reach.Zhang, 27, ultimately pulled away, ending the match on an overcooked forehand from Keys. The American hobbled off the court, her face in a towel, distraught at the outcome.More than an hour after her three-set loss, Keys gingerly walked to an area adjacent to the women's locker room with the assistance of her publicist.Keys, too injured to make the longer jaunt to the main interview roof, expressed her disappointment.In her last round, Keys strained an abdominal muscle, an injury she said also bothered her against Zhang.Amazingly, the 133rd-ranked Zhang had never advanced past the first round of a major in 14 previous attempts.",sports
"Milos Raonic struck a blow for the next generation of mens tennis by flooring former champion Stan Wawrinka on Monday to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals.Second seed Andy Murray, returning to court two days after his father-in-law was rushed to hospital, hit back for the old guard in the evening session at Rod Laver Arena though, banishing Bernard Tomic, the last home hope in the singles.Murrays win capped a banner day for Britain following Johanna Kontas advance, giving the nation mens and womens singles quarter-finalists at the same grand slam for the first time in nearly 40 years.Melbourne Park was rocked by corruption allegations on its opening day, and a week later, integrity fears returned as a former Australian professional player pleaded guilty to match-fixing at a Sydney court.Former world number 187 Nick Lindahl appeared in court just hours after a top global bookmaker suspended betting after heavy gambling on a mixed doubles match at Melbourne Park.The winning doubles pair dismissed suspicions over the match after being questioned by integrity officials. There was no questioning the commitment of Raonic and Wawrinka as the pair slugged out a three-hour 44-minute thriller in the day session on Rod Laver Arena.Long seen as a threat to the Novak Djokovic-led establishment, 25-year-old Raonic showed ice in his veins to fend off the 2014 champion 6-4 6-3 5-7 4-6 6-3 after the 30-year-old Swiss roared back from two sets down.Unveiling an aggressive serve-volley game, Raonic fired 82 winners past the fourth seed to set up a second successive quarter-final at Melbourne Park.Having lost to Djokovic a year ago, he will be favourite against French showman Gael Monfils who delighted fans with some spectacular dives as he beat Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 7-5 3-6 6-3 7-6(4) to reach the quarter-finals for the first time.Raonic is on an eight-match winning streak since the start of the year, a run which included upsetting Roger Federer to win the Brisbane International, and he credits new coach Carlos Moya for giving him confidence to stray from the baseline.""Hes sort of organising my strengths, my weapons and how to use them better,"" the 13th seed told reporters.

"Second seed Andy Murray had his feathers ruffled but scrapped his way into the Australian Open quarter-finals with a 6-4 6-4 7-6(4) victory over local hope Bernard Tomic on Monday.The Briton, four-times a runner-up at Melbourne Park, was close to exasperation after being broken four times by the unorthodox Australian world number 17 but dug deep when it mattered to reach the last eight for the seventh year in a row.Murray had endured a tricky couple of days since Nigel Sears, the father of his pregnant wife Kim, collapsed in the stands on Rod Laver Arena and was taken to hospital while the Scot was playing his third round tie on Margaret Court Arena.As Sears, the coach of Ana Ivanovic, has since been discharged and cleared to join his daughter in England, Murray hoped he would have a calmer preparation for his quarter-final encounter with Spanish eighth seed David Ferrer.Murray, 28, enjoyed success with the drop shot early in the match but that started to wane in a match that was always interesting if never turning into a real contest.Tomic, 23, showed flashes of the quality that has had Australia raving about his potential since his early teens but was unable to maintain the level of his performance for sufficiently long periods to cause an upset.Murray, who fired 18 aces and 43 winners, clinched a topsy turvy third set in the tiebreak when Tomic went long with a return after two and a half hours on court.""I just felt I was very uncomfortable,"" Tomic, who dropped serve three times in the first set, said.""While on paper it looked like a close match it was uncomfortable for me.<br/> I didnt play the game the way I wanted to but he didnt let me.""After Johanna Konta earlier earned her place in the quarter-finals, Murrays victory means Britain will have a presence in the last eight of both draws of a grand slam for the first time since the 1977 Australian Open.Murray has his eye firmly fixed on becoming Britains first mens champion in Australia since Fred Perry in 1934 but he must get past Ferrer to do it.

"A patient century stand between Hashim Amla and Temba Bavuma put South Africa in a commanding position at 223 for four at tea on day four of the final Test against England on Monday.Amla, a regular thorn in Englands side, was not out on 96 as he chases a second century in the match with Bavuma unbeaten on 63. The hosts led by 356 runs on a pitch that has turn, movement and uneven bounce.The pair have put on 117 for the fifth wicket and kept England wicketless between lunch and tea after the touring side had made good inroads in the opening session when a fired-up James Anderson grabbed two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.South Africa, who are likely to be down to three front-line bowlers in the second innings with seamer Kyle Abbott struggling due to a hamstring problem, must decide what target they want to set England with four sessions remaining.They will be mindful of overworking their depleted attack as they chase a consolation victory in the test with England already having claimed the series.The previous highest chase successful in Test matches at Centurion Park was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the contest and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.Anderson had earlier taken his number of test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw without scoring.It was the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in Test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.Stokes removed JP Duminy (29) caught behind by Bairstow to leave South Africa sweating at 106 for four, before Amla and Bavuma edged the home side ahead again.

"Englands nemesis Hashim Amla overcame a battered thumb and a lively wicket to post 50 not out and guide South Africa to 121 for four at lunch on day four of the final Test on Monday.The Proteas led by 254 runs on a rapidly deteriorating wicket with Amla and Temba Bavuma (nine not out) seeking to set England a record-breaking target if they are to win the series 3-0.The touring side bowled well in the morning session, with James Anderson grabbing two early wickets and Ben Stokes another.They have yet to dismiss Amla, though, as he showed great patience and steel while in obvious discomfort after being wrapped on the glove by Stokes on day three.He took his series runs tally to 424 at an average of 70.66 and remains the key in the Proteas posting a fourth-innings target they will feel is beyond England.Anderson had earlier taken his number of Test wickets to 433, one short of Indian great Kapil Dev in sixth place on the all-time list.He first induced a rash drive from opener Stephen Cook (25) that provided a catch for wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and two balls later grabbed the big scalp of home captain AB de Villiers, lbw for a duck.It would have been a satisfying moment for Anderson after De Villiers had suggested before the game that Englands bowlers had lost pace, with many suggesting he was alluding specifically to Anderson.It was also the third duck in a row for De Villiers, comfortably his worst run of form in test cricket since he made his debut in 2004.South Africa still have first-innings centurion Quinton de Kock to bat before England are in to the tail, but chasing anything over 300 on a wicket with variable bounce and movement will be extremely difficult.It would also be a record, the previous highest chase in test matches on this ground was 251 by England in 2000, though the pitch was only used for two days in that match after rain spoiled the test and the teams decided to forfeit an innings each to force a result.

""I think that makes me play better.

Yes!"" as he pumped his fist at the ground.Murray served out the set to even up the contest again and grabbed two breaks early in the decider as the wincing Raonics level dropped, the Canadians racket feeling the brunt of his frustration after the first.Murray finished off his ailing opponent with a sublime crosscourt backhand volley to bring up a match point, which he converted with a handsome forehand winner.The 28-year-old pointed both index fingers at the roof of Rod Laver Arena before slumping into his courtside chair with a look of relief on his face.The relief will not be long-lived, however, as he will be back on the same court on Sunday attempting to dethrone five-times champion Djokovic.Murrays older brother Jamie will be bidding for silverware on Saturday when he teams up with Bruno Soares to take on Daniel Nestor and Radek Stepanek in the mens doubles final.It is the first time two brothers have reached separate finals at the same grand slam.<br/> ""Youre not going to see it very often,"" Murray junior said.

"GUATEMALA CITY: Nearly $1 million in funds from soccer's global governing body FIFA may have gone missing from Guatemala's soccer federation last year, according to sources and an internal audit seen by Reuters.Dozens of soccer officials worldwide have been charged by U.S. authorities probing corruption in FIFA, in an investigation that has sent shockwaves across the sport.In 2015, the Guatemalan soccer federation (Fedefut) received 8.24 million quetzals ($1.1 mln) in nine deposits from FIFA from February to October, according to a document signed by the federation's accountant and seen by Reuters.The Fedefut budget presented early last year totaled about $1.5 million but only included about $250,000 in FIFA funding while the remaining funds from the nine deposits were not included, according to sources knowledgeable about the internal audit.The internal audit was conducted by a FIFA committee put in charge of running the Guatemalan soccer federation following the arrest on corruption charges last month of top local officials, and earlier on Friday the committee filed a complaint over the missing funds with the attorney general's office of the Central American country.The federation's year-end spending report excluded the additional deposits.The membership of Fedefut's general assembly was also not informed of the nine deposits.""That information was hidden,"" said one of the sources, adding that the results of an investigation into the missing funds will be provided to a visiting FIFA official next week.In one document, Fedefut's top budget official Oswaldo Rolando confirmed that the federation's financial division was informed of the extra deposits.""I don't know why they weren't made available to the general assembly,"" Rolando said in the documents.Ciro Muralles, the former head of the financial division, said in a brief phone interview that he would not comment on the missing funds until he reviews the documents.A spokesperson for the FIFA committee running Guatemala's soccer federation confirmed that the complaint seeks an investigation into ""the crimes that might have occurred.""Earlier this month, Guatemalan police arrested fugitive former Fedefut president Brayan Jimenez in connection with the corruption probe.Jimenez has been accused of taking bribes along with Hector Trujillo, former secretary general of the Guatemalan soccer federation, who was arrested last month in the United States.Both have denied the charges.",sports

No Member of the ICC is bigger than the other and I am determined to make a meaningful contribution in this regard with support of all the Members.",sports

" Mitchell Marsh kept calm after New Zealand got the sniff of an unlikely victory and scored his sixth one-day international half century to guide Australia to a four-wicket win in the second match of their one-day series on Saturday.The victory levelled the three-match series at 1-1 with the final game in Hamilton on Monday.Australia have not lost a bilateral one-day series since India in October, 2013.Marsh scored an unbeaten 69 and combined with John Hastings (48 not out) in an unbroken 86-run seventh-wicket partnership for the visitors as they overhauled New Zealands 281 for nine with 3.3 overs remaining.David Warner top scored with 98 in Australias 283-6, and combined with the recalled Usman Khawaja (50) in a 122-run opening stand that had set the foundation for their victory.Mitchell Santner had almost taken the game away from the visitors with his left-arm spin, breaking the opening partnership and then trapping Warner leg before when the aggressive opener was within sight of his sixth one-day century.Santner then had Matthew Wade brilliantly caught in the deep by Adam Milne for two to reduce the visitors to 197 for six in the 33rd over and give the hosts a sniff of victory in a game they had not played well enough to win.Too many overs were peppered with boundary balls as they struggled with their length on a wicket that had little help for the bowlers.They had also not posted a big enough target as their innings suffered from fits and starts with all of the batsmen, apart from Henry Nicholls, laying solid foundations only to fall when they needed to build.Kane Williamson top-scored with 60, though the hosts total was only pushed to a score considered defendable courtesy of a 61-run eighth-wicket stand between Santner (45 not out) and Milne (36).The 24-year-old Santner, who only made his international debut last year, is quickly impressing as an automatic selection in all formats of the game with his fluid batting and handy left-arm spin. (Reuters) -Saturdays match showcased his blossoming capabilities, with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation.Santner, who was joined by the right-handed Milne 12 runs later, however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm, turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary.Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood, however, ended the partnership, and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300, to finish with 3-61 from 10 overs.",sports
" New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell-Hadlee series alive.Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late-innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon.Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott, while John Hastings, Josh Hazlewood, Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball.Nevertheless, Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time. Usman Khawaja, among others, will be eager to make a difference.Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland, dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja, while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness, and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner. Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border.New Zealand, by contrast, were unchanged, in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007. Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings, clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen.Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen, but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled. That wicket scotched much of the early momentum, even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs.It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand, prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more. The chance swirled out towards deep cover, where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared. Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls, called up to the Test team this week, wafted at a wide delivery. New Zealand had stalled.Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command. This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa, who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing. His reward would come in consecutive overs, as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries.That put New Zealand five down, and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park. Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs, but the tourists could be happier with their effort.",sports

"A skilful performance from the left-arm duo of Mohammad Asghar and Wahab Riaz sealed Peshawar Zalmi's 24-run win in their opening fixture against Islamad United.Defending 145, Asghar's slow, loopy spinners derailed Islamabad's top order. He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over, Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah-ul-Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs. Shane Watson, who made 28, was their top-scorer, but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over.Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted, but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32. Asghar had a hand in those wickets too - he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches. So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches.In the first innings, Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run-a-ball half-century. It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar, having chosen to bat, had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end.

"Brendon McCullum's final one-day international innings ended as spectacularly as it began when the New Zealand captain was dismissed for 47 in the series finale against Australia in Hamilton on Monday.McCullum, who had hit six fours and three sixes in his 27-ball innings, was well caught by John Hastings at mid-off after charging down the wicket at fast bowling all rounder Mitchell Marsh only to miscue the shot.The 34-year-old was given a standing ovation at the sold out Seddon Park as he walked off and he gave heir apparent Kane Williamson a fist bump in a symbolic passing of the baton.McCullum will retire from all internationals after the second test against Steve Smith's side in Christchurch and he has been greeted by enthusiastic crowds throughout the one-day series, lauding his contribution to the game.On Monday McCullum battled to suppress his emotions during the coin toss, which he unsurprisingly lost, and was greeted by a guard of honour by the Australians with Smith shaking his hand.After being initially cautious, his first four scoring shots were boundaries.His first six, off Scott Boland, was a beautifully timed shot over long off. He hit Boland for two more sixes in the right armer's next over with the second dispatched over mid-wicket to bring up his 200th one-day international six.He is just the fourth player to hit 200 one-day sixes but the only one to have 100 in test cricket as well.He hit his sixth boundary off Mitchell Marshall in the 10th over when he guided the ball to the vacant third man boundary but was dismissed on the next ball with New Zealand 84-1",sports

"Joe Roots highest ODI score has left South Africa requiring a record chase if they are to avoid conceding a series-deciding defeat at the hands of England.Root's 125, the highest ODI score made by an England batsman against South Africa, has left the hosts needing to make the highest successful chase in an ODI at Centurion. West Indies' 300 for three, scored in 2004, is the record to date.In these days of great expectations of ODI scores, England's total of 318 for eight may not seem particularly extravagant. But on a cracked, two-paced pitch that challenges batsmen with uneven bounce, it is likely to prove a challenging target.South Africa lost the first two ODIs of the five-match series and are in danger of conceding defeat in the Test and ODI series to the same opposition during a home tour for the first time in 14 years.By the time South Africa struck for the fourth time, they could have been quietly satisfied with their work. Jos Buttler, again promoted to No. 4 to build upon the strong start from England's top order, had fallen first ball clipping to an intriguingly placed leg gully, while Eoin Morgan had laboured for 24 deliveries over his eight runs.But then Ben Stokes joined Root in a fifth-wicket stand of 82 in eight overs that took England's total from the average to the strong.",sports

"</Swing and seam friendly conditions, a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday.The Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and, even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off, McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat.Similarly-grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected, however, as both captains noted on Thursday.""I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect,"" McCullum said. ""The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen ... (and) you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score.""It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape.""Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2-0 last November, Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket.Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle, Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells, Starc and Johnson, both of whom created doubt, and at times fear, in the minds of batsmen.Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement.Last year at Trent Bridge, Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8-15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings.""We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so,"" Smith said.""The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly, a lot better than we have in recent times.""New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer, recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range.That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years.Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch.The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test, all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004.""I'm looking forward to these two test matches,"" McCullum said. ""It will be a great series, two evenly matched teams.""Not a better way to go out really.""",sports

"On a dry surface in a dusty Ranchi ground, India's top order moved into customary home form, and their bowlers exposed a fragile Sri Lanka top order. Shikhar Dhawan was bruiser-in-prime, unleashing an early shellacking that brought him 51, and set the team on course to a big total. They reached 196 for 6, thanks to helpful hands from the top five, which today included a pinch-hitting Hardik Pandva. That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka.On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement, the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win, were expensive. Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat-trick - to Thisara Perera - barely made a difference, coming as it did in the penultimate over. Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first.R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top, and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here. Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball, and the chase never really recovered from that. Soon they were 3 for 16, Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps. Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory, and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs, as the required rate crept up through the teens. Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs.Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery, but departed soon after, nicking a throat-high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper. That wicket bought Sri Lanka brief respite. They bowled five overs for 30, before the runs began to flow again.Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over, with an athletic return catch, and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after, but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat. After two sighters he began his assault.Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge, taking particular liking to Chameera, whose figures he ruined. Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs, Chameera saw his third disappear for 18. His last also went for 10. In between Perera took a low-key hat-trick, having Pandya, Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses. His figures were dramatically improved as a result. He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs.Dilshan was stumped over-reaching off the first ball he faced. Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus, but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball, and chewed up four balls for one run. Danushka Gunathilaka amplified Sri Lanka's problems at the top of the order with another poor score.Kapugedara and Chandimal's 49-ball fourth-wicket partnership yielded only 52 runs. By the time they had departed, off successive Jadeja deliveries in the 12th over, the required rate had climbed to more than 14.5, and the chase was kaput. Dasun Shanaka and Milinda Siriwardana struck some late sixes, doing good to at least their own batting confidence, if nothing much for the team cause.",sports

"Stuart Broad returns to the England side for the first time since the 2015 World Cup.Broad was dropped from the white-ball sides after a disappointing tournament in Australia and New Zealand and also missed out on selection for England's World T20 squad, announced earlier this week.But he has never made any secret of his desire to return and has often stated his ambition to feature in the ICC Champions Trophy, in 2017, and the World Cup, in 2019. Both those events will be held in England.Broad enjoyed an excellent Test on this ground less than a month ago, where he claimed 6 for 17 in the second innings to help England secure the series.He may find conditions less helpful this time, though. There is a painfully short boundary on one side of the ground and the pitch appears to lack the cracks he exploited so well during the Test.Broad replaces David Willey in the side for this match, while Chris Woakes, who was also omitted from the World T20 squad, returns to the England side in place of Chris Jordan, who has taken one wicket in 17.3 overs in the series, at an average of 143 and an economy rate of 8.17.

" Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja hammered home the advantage their bowlers had established when they took Australia to 147-3, a deficit of just 36 runs, at the close of the opening days play in the first Test against New Zealand on Friday.Australia captain Smith, who won the toss and sent New Zealand in to bat on a green Basin Reserve pitch, shook off some recent poor form to reach 71 before he was caught and bowled by Mark Craig.Khawaja scored his fourth Test half century with 57 not out, while Adam Voges (seven not out) was bowled by Doug Bracewell in the final over of the day only to survive because of a contentious no ball. Television replays showed the delivery was clearly legal.The tourists had earlier dismissed New Zealand for 183, Josh Hazlewood and Peter Siddle reducing them to 51-5 in the 12th over and Nathan Lyon polishing off the tail after lunch.Hazlewood finished with 4-42, Siddle took 3-37, while off-spinner Lyon grabbed 3-32 and the tea break was taken 10 minutes early when Trent Boult was caught at long on for 24.Craig top-scored with 41 not out but the pitch appeared to have lost much of its bite by the end of New Zealands innings, which lasted 48 overs.Tim Southee, however, managed to get rid of both Joe Burns (0) and David Warner (5) to leave the visitors 5-2 in the third over and with the sell-out crowd in full voice.Southee and Boult kept up the pressure on Smith and Khawaja but when they scored 37 runs, from nine fours and a single, in 16 deliveries, the shackles were broken and crowd silenced.Smith was eventually dismissed about 20 minutes before stumps when he hit the ball back to Craig to end the 126-run partnership.The crowd began the day celebrating McCullums milestone as he became just the third New Zealander to earn 100 Test caps and the first man in world cricket to achieve them in succession from debut.Australia, however, seized control of the match shortly after Smith won the toss and simply bowled straight and waited for the ball to do just enough to catch the outside edge.New Zealands first seven wickets all fell to catches behind the stumps, but the last three, all Lyons victims, were caught in front from mis-timed attacking shots.

" Adam Voges continued to capitalise on an early reprieve by scoring his fifth Test century as Australia eased to 463 for six by the close of the second days play of the first match against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve on Saturday.Voges was unbeaten on 176 at stumps with Peter Siddle on 29 as the Australians stretched their advantage to 280 runs, snuffing out any hope New Zealand had of claiming victory in captain Brendon McCullums 100th Test.The 36-year-old Voges has made the most of a lifeline when he was bowled by Doug Bracewell for seven with two deliveries remaining on Friday, only for umpire Richard Illingworth to signal a no-ball.Television replays showed the delivery was legal but because the infraction had been called on the field, New Zealand were unable to ask for a review.Voges was involved in partnerships of 168 with Usman Khawaja (140) and 96 with wicketkeeper Peter Nevill (32) to prevent New Zealand from gaining any momentum on a tough day for the hosts.New Zealand briefly appeared to be in position to expose the Australian tail during the middle session when Trent Boult took two wickets, including Khawajas, in three deliveries but Voges calmly ensured that the visitors maintained their dominance.The late-blooming Voges, who was 35 when he made his debut against West Indies last June, has scored 1,204 runs in a bountiful Test career to date, boasting a high score of 269 not out and an average of 100.33.As Australia resumed on 147-3 in response to New Zealands 183 all out, the only excitement for locals at a sold-out Basin Reserve came during that eventful Boult over in the middle session.Corey Anderson claimed the only other wicket of the day when he enticed Nevill to edge behind to make the score 395-6.While Australia have batted themselves into a position they are unlikely to lose from, New Zealands past record at the Basin Reserve should provide local fans with some hope.In their last two matches at the Wellington ground, they conceded large first innings leads before scoring 680-8 to save a test against India two years ago and 524-5 to set up a win last year against Sri Lanka.The second Test of the two-match series is in Christchurch from Feb.20-24.

However, despite the defeat, other results in the tournament meant that Peshawar were through to the playoffs.Lahore, after being inserted, lost Chris Gayle for a first-ball duck, but Delport put up fifty-plus stands with Azhar Ali (25) and Umar Akmal to seize the advantage.Delport's partnership with Akmal for the third wicket yielded 101 runs; Delport hit six fours and three sixes for his 78, while Akmal's 31-ball 52 featured six fours. Their efforts ensured that Peshawar needed to chase at more than eight an over right from the off.Tamim Iqbal kept the runs flowing for Peshawar with a quick 30, but the team lost wickets in a cluster to soon fall to 95 for 4.Peshawar needed 70 runs from 46 balls at that time, but Malan blew new wind into his team's chase by blasting a 35-ball 42 with three sixes. His blows brought the equation down to 18 off the last two overs, but Malan was trapped lbw by Kevon Cooper off the first ball in the penultimate over, tilting the contest back Lahore's way.Peshawar needed 16 off the last over, and despite a six from Wahab Riaz, they could only muster 160 for 7.

I have spent a lot of time outside and it hurts me when Pakistan loses.""Ajmal said he bowled with weights strapped to his wrist and ankles to iron out kinks in his action, which he blamed on a broken wrist following a bus accident.He has had to sacrifice some bounce and spin, and the occasional delivery can exceed the 15 degree elbow extension limit but Ajmal said he still had enough variation to trouble batsmen.""I will leave cricket with this (new) action. If I am not effective, I will step aside and leave. ""The odd ball might have exceeded 20 degrees but I work hard immediately to rectify that. I watch every video of my matches.

"South Africa recorded their first ever women's T20 victory over England to level the three-match series at 1-1. In a rain-interrupted innings, South Africa, anchored by Dane van Niekerk 's second successive fifty, held their nerve and paced their chase well to ensure Sunday's fixture will be a decider.After England defended 147 in Paarl a day ago, they would have thought they had enough when they crept over that total at Newlands. Sarah Taylor formed the spine of the innings, as she did in the first match, but she also had greater support. She shared in a 61-run second-wicket stand with Charlotte Edwards and a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership with Heather Knight but South Africa, helped by wayward bowling and clumsy fielding from England, were not overawed.Van Niekerk, who was dropped on 6 and 22, set the tone when she dispatched a loosener from Anya Shrubsole and then punished Danielle Hazell, who erred in length. She was almost run out, too, when Trisha Chetty sent her back even though she had advanced more than halfway down the wicket from the non-striker's end. The throw from Hazell came in at the striker's end instead but quick work from Taylor ensured Chetty was out.If van Niekerk was shaken by it, she did not show any signs and struck the first six of the innings with a slog sweep. She hit the ball with power and fine placement and beat short third man with a delicate lap to enter the 40s. Her fifty came via a pull off the 34th ball she faced. That shot also took South Africa halfway to the target.They were well placed on 80 for 1 after 10 overs and England could not pull them back. Jenny Gunn was punished for width but, just as South Africa seemed to get away, Rebecca Grundy struck. She beat van Niekerk, who had come down the track, and Taylor whipped the bails off.The first rains fell at the end of that over but South Africa, at 108 for 2, were well ahead on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern and Marizanne Kapp had already showed her intent to finish things off fast with two furious pulls.The delay was short and Mignon du Preez and Kapp kept South Africa above the required rate, so that when the second interruption happened, four over and two balls later, South Africa were still ahead despite Kapp's dismissal. More rain followed and the players did not get back on but South Africa's batsmen had earned their first win over England after 14 attempts.",sports

"CHRISTCHURCH: Brendon McCullum blasted the fastest test century to rescue New Zealand before Australia were reduced to 57 for one by the close of day one of the second test on Saturday.The New Zealand captain scored a brilliant 145, with his first 100 runs coming from 54 balls, as the hosts were dismissed for 370 after tea at Hagley Oval in Christchurch.Trent Boult then had the dangerous David Warner caught at second slip by Martin Guptill for 12, before Joe Burns (27) and Usman Khawaja (18) saw the Australians through to the close.New Zealand had no right to be in the position they were at stumps after being sent in to bat by Steve Smith on a green wicket and reduced to 32 for three inside 20 overs.McCullum, playing his 101st and final test with his team trailing 1-0 in the two-match series, led a counter-attack that began before lunch and reached its bludgeoning best in the afternoon session.Fast bowlers were charged, nicks flew and improvisation mixed with pure cricket shots as McCullum and Corey Anderson took to Australias bowlers in 75 scintillating minutes after lunch.The onslaught came after McCullum was caught in the gully by Mitchell Marsh when on 39, only to be recalled as television replays showed fast bowler James Pattinson had over-stepped.Already bristling with aggression, the second life flicked a switch for McCullum and he went into all-out attack mode, reaching his century 24 balls later with his 16th boundary.He needed two fewer balls than the 56 that West Indies Viv Richards required for his century against England in Antigua in 1986 and Pakistans Misbah-ul-Haq took against Australia in Abu Dhabi in 2014.McCullum also hit four sixes in his first 100 runs, his first before lunch securing outright ownership of the record for career sixes in test cricket.He had started the day tied with Australias Adam Gilchrist on 100. He was eventually dismissed when Nathan Lyon took a good catch in the deep to end a 179-run partnership with Anderson, who reached his fourth test half-century from 39 balls and was dismissed for 72 shortly before tea.Lyon grabbed two wickets after tea, with wicketkeeper BJ Watling the last man out for 58.Until McCullum and Andersons pyro-technics, Australia had been well in control, reducing the hosts to 74 for four with Kane Williamsons dismissal for seven after lunch.Williamson had tried to rebuild New Zealands innings under pressure from superb pace bowling that captured the wickets of Martin Guptill (18), Tom Latham (four) and Henry Nicholls (seven).",sports

"Sarah Taylor scored a third successive half-century and became the second player after Charlotte Edwards to score 2000 runs in the format as England sealed the three-match series against South Africa 2-1. Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase - the first time England have batted second in the series - after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4.England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery. They shared an 89-run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback - Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career-best - but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield, never looked enough.South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant, the left-armer making her first appearance in the series, had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide. In the next over, Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk, who was playing in her 50th T20I, and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries. She was not far away from a hat-trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman.Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain, du Preez. They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator. The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance. Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on.South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage. Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England, started to speed up the scoring rate. South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down.With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left, South Africa's urgency grew. Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly. She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs. They still ended with the lowest first-innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend.England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail. She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind. But, as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough, it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long. While Taylor scored freely, Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope, although with Taylor at the crease, England could always feel safe.Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut. With Knight playing a supporting role, England were well on their way. Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls.South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets - van Niekerk took a stunning one-handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over - but England reached the target with 4.3 overs to spare. Tammy Beaumont, who had been moved down from opening to the middle, played confidently to finish unbeaten on 21.",sports

"CHRISTCHURCH: Joe Burns and Usman Khawaja reduced Australias victory target to 131 runs with nine wickets in hand at the end of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Hagley Oval on Tuesday.Burns was on 27, while Khawaja was 19 not out with Australia 70 for one after being set 201 runs to win the match and series 2-0.They had earlier dismissed the hosts in their second innings for 335 after tea.David Warner was the only wicket to fall when he was caught down the leg side by BJ Watling from Neil Wagner for 22, though New Zealand needed to ask for a review to determine the ball had glanced his gloves.Jackson Bird grabbed his first five-wicket haul to help wrap up New Zealands second innings after tea that had been characterised by stubborn middle and lower-order resistance.Bird, who had grabbed three quick wickets after lunch, including the key scalp of Kane Williamson (97), bowled Matt Henry for 66 -- his first half century and highest score -- then had Trent Boult caught for a duck to finish with 5-59.James Pattinson finished with 4-77, but had the most important wicket in the final session on Tuesday when he dismissed Watling for 46 after the wicketkeeper had combined with Henry in a crucial 118-run partnership.Until their eighth-wicket stand, the hosts had been in danger of being dismissed with a lead of only about 100 after Bird had broken a 102-run partnership between Williamson and Corey Anderson (40) that had got their side into credit.The pair batted through a heated first session in which Australia dropped two catches, had two reviews turned down and an lbw decision overturned.The second review, just before lunch and against Williamson, prompted a petulant outburst from captain Steve Smith and Josh Hazlewood, with the tall fast bowler likely to face further sanctions after microphones picked up his expletive-laden rant.New Zealand had begun the day on 121 for four, 14 runs in arrears of Australias 505, but their stubborn resistance ensured the match would enter a fifth and final day.The target also appeared competitive though not overly challenging on a good batting surface and Australia should seal victory to reclaim the number one ranking in Test cricket, though Anderson said his side would make it tough for the visitors.

"Pakistans inaugural national cricket league has been an unexpected success, even though all the matches have been played in the United Arab Emirates.Since the Pakistan Super League (PSL) was announced last September, the countrys cricket board has sold five franchises for $93 million and attracted players from 11 different countries.They include big names like West Indies batsman Chris Gayle and former internationals Kumar Sangakkara of Sri Lanka and Englands Kevin Pietersen.The biggest surprise, however, has been the response from Pakistans public.Since matches began in the UAE on Feb. 4, television viewing figures have been higher than for the 2015 World Cup.Tuesdays championship match between Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators in Dubai is expected to attract similar figures.The match is sold out.""Big businesses have bought the franchises, millions of people have tuned in even though the matches arent in Pakistan, and our own young cricketers are getting a chance to rub shoulders with giants,"" PSL chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters.""This is the most extraordinary moment for Pakistani cricket since we were exiled from the international game.""HOME SOILIt is still unclear when the PSL will be able to stage its first match on home soil.Pakistan has been forced to play designated home matches primarily in the United Arab Emirates since 2009 when the Sri Lankan team was ambushed by militants while travelling from their hotel to Lahores Gaddafi stadium for a test match.Many see PSL as a turning-point, not just for the countrys cash-strapped cricket board but also for young cricketers who have missed out on opportunities to interact with and learn from leading international players.Among those who have bought the franchise are Habib Bank Limited, the countrys biggest bank, Haier Group, a major electronics and home appliances company, and Qatar Oil.If all goes according to plan, PSL will generate revenues of approximately $50 million, according to cricket board estimates.A 10-year forecast sees the board making profits of $50-60 million.Given the size of Pakistans potential market of 180 million people, cricket experts say it is possible to imagine the PSL becoming one of the worlds biggest cricket leagues.""It would not be outlandish to say that PSL could soon be the worlds third largest league,"" Osman Samiuddin, author of The Unquiet Ones: A History of Pakistan Cricket, said, comparing PSL to the Indian and Australian domestic leagues.""Looking at how successful this season has been, how much the public has enjoyed it, and the fact that it has generated a real revenue stream for the cricket board, I would say its possible.""Despite the success of PSLs first season, the real test for the cricket board will be if it can permanently bring the game back home.""Next year, we hope to have at least the opening and closing PSL matches on Pakistani soil,"" PSL Chairman Sethi said.

"Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini, once the two most powerful men in world football, had their bans for ethics violations upheld on Wednesday, although they were reduced from eight years to six.The 79-year-old Blatter, who served for 17 years as FIFA president, and Platini, 60, one of the greatest players of all time and UEFA president since 2007, had appealed against the bans imposed last October.The ruling came two days before FIFA holds a special elective Congress to appoint a successor to Blatter, who was President of the ruling body from 1998 before standing down four days after winning his final term of office last May.Neither man will be at Friday's Congress following the decision and Platini could hardly contain his wrath.""The decision is insulting, shameful and is a violation of rights,"" he said in a statement.""The charges against me are baseless, built from the ground up and surreal in view of the facts and the explanations I gave during the hearing.""I will go to the end of my fight to show that Im innocent, to restore my rights and identify who is responsible for this plot.""There was no immediate response from Blatter.DARK NIGHTThe pair will now turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for the last chance to restore their reputations and roles in the game.The final verdict from FIFA's headquarters, though, came on a rainy evening in Zurich.The statement issued by the Appeal Panel, while upholding the ban, did determine that ""some strong mitigating factors for Mr Platini and Mr Blatter were not taken into account when establishing the sanction.""One of the factors for reducing the ban was the pair's lifetime service to football.Blatter and Platini were banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs ($2.03 million) made to the Frenchman in 2011 by FIFA with Blatter's approval for work done a decade earlier.They said the payment honoured a verbal or gentleman's agreement made in 1998 for work carried out by the Frenchman when he was a technical adviser to Blatter.SUSPENSION IMPOSEDThe decision not to overturn the bans followed the 12-year suspension imposed on Jerome Valcke, who was sacked as FIFA's secretary general last month.Valcke, the man responsible for running FIFA's day-to-day administration, was found guilty of misconduct over the sale of World Cup tickets, abuse of travel expenses, attempting to sell TV rights below their market value and destruction of evidence.Platini was European Footballer of the Year three times while Blatter worked at FIFA for 41 years after originally joining as Technical Director in 1975. He served as Secretary General from 1981 until he succeeded Joao Havelange as president in 1998.Blatter's reign was mired in controversy and the announcement that he was resigning came in June, less than a week after American and Swiss authorities arrested FIFA and other officials at a Zurich hotel on corruption charges, two days before the Congress and election took place.Platini was, for many years, regarded as Blatter's natural successor and they worked harmoniously before rifts occurred in their relationship.Platini was openly critical of Blatter in the run-up to last year's election, but both have been united again in being brought down by the scandal that has rocked their sport.",sports

"World crickets most intriguing rivalry will once again be renewed when India take on an unpredictable Pakistan with rehabilitated pacer Mohammed Amir being the focus of attention in a roundrobin league encounter of the Asia Cup T20 tournament here today (Saturday).The match will also serve as a precursor to the two teams opening round battle in the ICC World Twenty20 next month.The IndoPak cricket contests over the years have carried a legacy not to forget the political undercurrents involved whenever the two bitter neighbours square off on the 22 yards.But the most exciting aspect will be whether the tainted Amir gets to play in the XI.Back after serving a fiveyear ban for spotfixing Amir has started playing for the national team since the tour of New Zealand and this immensely talented bowler will certainly come out all guns blazing against the Indian batsmen.Virat Kohli has already welcomed Amir s return but not much is known as to what other Indian players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni think about the convicted spot fixer s inclusion.In India, the BCCI has taken a zero tolerance approach imposing life bans on players like S Sreesanth, Ankeet Chavan, Ajit Chandila who have no hopes of returning to competitive cricket.For Amir, though a good performance against India will probably help him gain some credibility not only in the dressing room but also among the common cricketloving public in Pakistan.In terms of preparation, both teams have been suitably prepared considering the amount of Twenty20 cricket they have played in the past one month.India already kicked off their World T20 preparations in style having won six out of the seven games played so far.Pakistan cricketers on the other hand are coming straight after playing in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) which keeps them well prepared.Traditionally, India have never ever lost to Pakistan in the global events but it has not been the case in the continental event where Shahid Afridi and co have performed well.However the Asia Cup has never been played in the T20 format which is also a first.

A 33-run partnership between Nipuni Hansika and Chamari Atapattu provided Sri Lanka respite, but it was brief - when Bisht had Hansika stumped off the first ball of the tenth over, it opened a passage of play in which five wickets fell for 11 runs in 5.3 overs.An eighth-wicket partnership of 39 off 29 balls between Eshani Lokusuriyage and Ama Kanchana then steered the tourists to their final total of 89 for 9.India made light work of the chase, as openers Vellaswamy Vanitha and Smriti Mandhana put on 64 in 8.4 overs. Vanitha's dismissal was Sri Lanka's only success with the ball; Veda Krishnamurthy joined Mandhana to knock off the remaining 26 runs with 37 balls to spare.",sports

"Crisis-hit world football governing body FIFA faces one of the most important days in its 112-year history when it elects a new leader on Friday hoping to usher in a fresh era after decades of tawdry controversy.Delegates from more than 200 countries will vote for a new president to succeed Sepp Blatter, two days after the disgraced Swiss and European football chief Michel Platini lost their appeals against bans for ethics violations.A wide-ranging set of reforms, which are designed to prevent corruption, will be voted on before the FIFA election and are expected to be passed. They include term limits for top officials and disclosure of their earnings.Whoever takes over from Blatter, who ran FIFA for 17 years like a globe-trotting head of state, will inherit a very different job with the focus on crisis management, after dozens of international football officials were indicted in the United States last year for racketeering, money-laundering and bribery.Asian Football Confederation (AFC) president Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa is the bookmaker's favourite with UEFA's Swiss general secretary Gianni Infantino a close second.Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein believes he is still firmly in the race however, while Frenchman Jerome Champagne and South African Tokyo Sexwale will hope to make an impact.There was little indication on Thursday, though, that the vote would be anything other than a two-horse race between Sheikh Salman and Infantino.""I am feeling good and very positive. The support I am receiving fills me with confidence, Infantino told Reuters.A spokesman for his Bahraini rival said: ""Sheikh Salman is very confident about tomorrows vote.""The CONCACAF confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean opted against endorsing a candidate and delegates suggested that support within the region was divided.With no block vote from those 35 delegates, Africa's decision now looks set to be the decisive factor.African countries make up more than a quarter of the 207 football associations eligible to vote. On the final day of campaigning, there were sharply conflicting versions of how they would cast their ballots.While the vice-president of their continental federation said virtually all would back Sheikh Salman, several delegates told Reuters the African vote would be split.Infantino has said he was confident of winning more than half of the African votes, while Liberian football chief Musa Bility predicted the possibly unlikely scenario of 27 of the region's votes going to Jordan's Prince Ali.""The world is waiting and watching -- this is the biggest milestone in the history of FIFA. It will decide if FIFA goes ahead as we want or if it spirals down,"" Prince Ali told delegates.Former anti-apartheid militant turned businessman and politician Sexwale described FIFA as broken and a damaged brand, though he also referred to some of those felled in the scandal as ""friends we have lost"".Infantino repeated his promise to offer each of FIFA's members $5 million to invest in the sport over four years, more than doubling the $2.05 million each federation got from 2011-14. He said this could be achieved ""easily"" by tackling the cost structure of FIFA.Bahrain's Salman was again more cautious, though, speaking of a 'realistic' increase in funding.""For me, if the numbers are right, we can increase -- but I am not ready to mortgage FIFAs future in winning an election.""French outsider Champagne took a shot at Infantinos globe-trotting campaign by saying the election had been ""unbalanced"".""I did not have a private jet to visit you, take a photo and then tweet and say I have got the endorsement,"" he said to laughter from delegates.Prince Ali told UEFA delegates if he won the election he would appoint a European as his secretary general but did not offer up a name.CORRUPTION PROBESFIFA was plunged into turmoil by the corruption scandal that broke last year, beginning with a dawn raid to arrest delegates at a Swiss luxury hotel.Criminal investigations led by the United States and Switzerland have spanned dozens of countries, focusing largely on the awarding of lucrative broadcast and marketing rights to the world's most popular sport.They are also examining the process by which FIFA awarded the next two World Cups to Russia and Qatar.Acting FIFA president Issa Hayatou appealed to FIFA members in what he called one of the most important weeks in the history of global football, calling on them to back the package of reforms on governance.""I urge each of you to support the reforms in full here this week, and then to implement them to their entirety at home,"" Hayatou said in an address aimed at the six confederations that run football around the world.""This will send a strong message that we have listened and that we are taking the action necessary to give football the Foundation, and protection, it needs for the future.""",sports

""I have strong, dear thoughts for Mr Michel Platini right now.""Only the ninth president in FIFA's 112-year history, he inherits a very different job from that enjoyed by Blatter, who toured the world for 17 years like a head of state, dispensing development funds to his global support base.Before the election, the Congress had overwhelmingly passed a set of reforms intended to make FIFA more transparent, professional and accountable.That package should mean the new president faces much closer scrutiny than Blatter did -- his salary will be published for the first time -- and have less influence over the day-to-day management of the organisation's business affairs.",sports

"Coming jubilant from UAE following successful holding of Pakistan Super League (PSL), but the men in green conceded a humiliating defeat from arch-rival India in their Asia Cup opener, which they would want to forget as soon as possible starting with a big victory against minnows UAE when the two teams clash on Monday here in Mirpur.For its part, Pakistan was taken by surprise at the way the pitch played on Saturday, Shoaib Malik said after Pakistan was defeated by India.Pakistan slipped and slid to 83 against India, Sarfraz Ahmeds 24-ball 25 the only innings of substance. Mohammad Amir put in a fantastic spell at the top of Indias innings to keep Pakistan in the game, but only just.We made some mistakes. We didnt know what the conditions here would be. Now we have played, now we know how to deal with it, said Malik on the sidelines of the Pakistan teams training session on the afternoon before the match.We had miscalculated. It wasnt a typical T20 wicket where you look at 170 or 180. We know we have the best attack among all teams. But the batsmen have to take responsibility. Whoever gets in has to score 60-70, so the team ends up scoring 140-150, which the bowlers can defend.We should have scored 130. We had two run outs. Otherwise one of them might have gone on to score 40-50. Here, 130-plus is a great score, unless the conditions change.<br/> <br/> Its unlikely that Pakistan will be worrying too much about its bowling. Amir, as well as Mohammad Sami, bowled extremely well against India, while Mohammad Irfan troubled Indias batsmen no end. Wahab Riaz did, however, have an average day, but it could well have been an aberration.Like with UAE, its the batting that Pakistan has to address. And fast. Both Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have already beaten UAE and India could too, going by form. So winning on Monday is non-negotiable for Pakistan. But the idea must be put up a big performance - with the ball, of course; even more so with the bat.<br/> <br/> Since qualifying for this level in 2014, UAE has played three Twenty20 Internationals against Test-playing nations, two of them in this tournament and one against Zimbabwe earlier.

"Stan Wawrinka edged out Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in a nerve-jangling, near-30 minute tiebreak to secure the Dubai Duty Free Championship with a 6-4 7-6(13) triumph on Saturday.Wawrinkas path to victory had been eased by the retirements of world number one Novak Djokovic and Australian prospect Nick Kyrgios in the earlier rounds but the Swiss often toiled against surprise finalist Baghdatis, whom he beat for a sixth successive time.World number four Wawrinka was gifted the first set by a Baghdatis double fault -- his third of that game alone -- and a tepid second set was notable for not featuring a single break point.But then followed a 28-point tiebreak in which twice grand slam champion Wawrinka saved five set points before a Baghdatis backhand drifted long to give the Swiss a second title of the year following his victory in Chennai in January.Baghdatis initially played serve and volley with aplomb, while Wawrinkas stinging backhand was lethal from the baseline, but that early assurance proved fleeting as both players made a catalogue of errors.Wawrinka afforded Baghdatis two break points after whipping a forehand wide and the Cypriot converted following another wayward Swiss forehand for a 3-2 first-set lead.Wawrinka, who was within two points of suffering opening-round elimination at the Aviation Club, immediately broke back with a crosscourt winner past the advancing Baghdatis, who was seeking a first title since 2010.The pair were content to trade half-paced shots from the back of the court and when either did up the tempo it usually failed.World number 57 Baghdatis, serving at 4-5, saved four set points but his serve deserted him again as he conceded the set.The second set went with serve before an attritional tiebreak in which Baghdatis fluffed chances to square the match and Wawrinka threw his racket in frustration after missing an easy forehand.

My job is to only pass on my knowledge and skills and give them more confidence when it comes to executing bowling plans. I am enjoying each moment of mine with the Pakistan team and hopefully I can pass on my experience to the younger lot in the line up, he said.I have played around the world and have enough experience under my belt to help them with little things. I would be more than happy to help them get better in their skill not just from the bowling perspective but batting and fielding as well, Azhar added.",sports
"Fledgling forward Marcus Rashford is keen to continue his ""crazy"" start to life in the Manchester United first team after impressing with two more goals in Sunday's 3-2 win over title-chasing Arsenal.The 18-year-old's double against the Gunners came after he notched twice on his first team debut in the 5-1 dismantling of Danish side Midtjylland in the Europa League on Thursday and the young forward was as blown away as anyone by his instant impact.""It's just crazy. This is my first game in the Premier League so obviously it's been amazing, and to score two has been a bonus. So hopefully we can carry it on and go again the next game,"" Rashford told Sky Sports.Rashford said his late inclusion on Thursday, after Anthony Martial was injured in the warm-up, had probably helped him.""It was a shock playing midweek ... But that maybe benefited me because I wasn't thinking about the game too much, so it's been good,"" the Manchester-born player said.The victory over Arsenal left United in fifth, three points behind Manchester City who have a game in hand on their rivals and occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot.Spanish midfielder Juan Mata heaped praise on his young team mate but also highlighted the impact of the other academy graduates, who have plugged the holes of United's injury-ravaged first team squad of late.""Marcus is on fire. He scored two goals against Midtjylland and now again against Arsenal,"" Mata told the club's website.""... but the others who came in to play in defence and midfield were also great. I think today is a day to be proud of the club and its academy - we've shown the level that we have.""",sports

"On the face of it, the India v Sri Lanka game at the Asia Cup T20 2016 at Sher-e-Bangla Stadium in Mirpur on Tuesday (March 1) pits two sides, who have had contrasting recent form against each other.India has done most things right so far. In the opener against Bangladesh, the batsmen started slowly but Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya exploded towards the close, and the bowling pack did exactly what MS Dhoni would have hoped for to stop the opposition well short. The win over Pakistan was equally comprehensive. Apart from three overs from Mohammad Amir early on and a phase when Mohammad Irfan troubled Yuvraj Singh, it was one-way traffic.Sri Lanka, on the other hand, started well via Tillakaratne Dilshan and Dinesh Chandimal in its first game against UAE but ended up scoring only 129 for 8. And though there was never any real danger of the target being crossed, it took Lasith Malingas brilliance to ensure the chase stopped at 115 for 9. Against Bangladesh, with Malinga sitting out, Sri Lanka was overwhelmed.There was no word on Malingas availability for the match, discomfort in the knee making his comeback after three months out last only one game. A team spokesperson said that Malinga was recovering. Keeping the ICC World Twenty20 2016 in mind, Malinga probably will be fielded only if the team is confident that it wont be harmful for him in the longer run.India might also be without Rohit Sharma, the inswinging yorker from Amir that sent him on his way on Saturday having left an impact on Rohits left big toe. He didnt train on Monday, though it was announced that there was no fracture and Rohit wasnt in any pain.The good news for India, meanwhile, was that Shikhar Dhawan was in fine fettle the day before the game, spending a fair bit of time knocking the ball around in the nets.<br/> <br/> India has been on a roll of late, while Sri Lanka hasnt had things going its way. The last series either side played was against each other - a three-match affair in India, where India lost in the first match in Pune, but the then bounced back well to take the series 2-1.The pitches for all but one Asia Cup match have been pacer friendly, much like the track in Pune was, where Kasun Rajitha, Dasun Shanaka and Dushmantha Chameera made the big-name India batting keel over.Sri Lanka did that in Pune. But everything India did in the three games before that in Australia and then the remainder of the series against Sri Lanka and then here at the Asia Cup suggest a team at the top of its game, with most cogs of wheel spinning smoothly.If Malinga makes a great recovery and gets on to the field, Sri Lanka will wear a stronger look but still not be the favourite on paper, with India doing all the heavy hitting so far.Teams (from)India: MS Dhoni (captain &amp; wk), R Ashwin, Jasprit Bumrah, Shikhar Dhawan, Harbhajan Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Virat Kohli, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Pawan Negi, Ashish Nehra, Hardik Pandya, Parthiv Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, Rohit Sharma, Yuvraj Singh.Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (captain), Angelo Mathews, Dushmantha Chameera, Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Niroshan Dickwella, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Rangana Herath, Shehan Jayasuriya, Chamara Kapugedara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Thisara Perera, Sachithra Senanayake, Dasun Shanaka, Milinda Siriwardena, Jeffrey Vandersay.

"Afghanistan stretched their T20I record against Scotland to 6-0 with a 14-run win facilitated by their explosive opener Mohammad Shahzad and a spin-heavy attack to defend 170.Scotland were well on course in the chase after their openers packed a powerful stand of 84 runs in under nine overs, but the Afghanistan spinners dismissed the openers and then strangled the middle order to throw the chase off track.Scotland needed 77 runs from the half-way mark with eight wickets in hand but the Afghanistan spinners lived up to their captain's decision of batting first to allow the slower bowlers to do their work later on.On what looked like a slower pitch after the opening match in Nagpur, the two teams were set for much stronger totals after the platforms laid by their top orders. But both innings were jolted in the middle overs and Afghanistan eventually prevailed to start their World T20 campaign with a win, to bury memories of their Asia Cup opening-match loss against UAE last month.Shahzad started in his usual aggressive fashion and overcame some improvised bowling from the Scotland pacers in the Powerplay to cut loose later on.Shahzad and Noor Ali Zadran provided a flying start by putting on 25 in under three overs before Noor Ali steered a short ball straight to third man.Shahzad followed that by targeting the leg-side and straight boundaries to race towards a 32-ball fifty, his ninth in T20Is.",sports

"A jury on Monday found a Nashville hotel liable for a nude video of sportscaster Erin Andrews that went viral and awarded her $55 million in damages to be paid by the hotel and the man who shot the video.Andrews sued the Nashville Marriott at Vanderbilt University over a 2008 video of her that was taken by a stalker in an adjoining room and posted on the Internet in 2009. Andrews, a Fox sportscaster who used to work for ESPN, had sought $75 million in damages.""We're disappointed with the outcome,"" defense attorney Marc Dedman told reporters. He said he would consult with his clients - the hotel owners and its former operators - on whether they would appeal.Jurors began deliberating on Monday morning after the two-week trial concluded on Friday.""I've been honored by all the support from victims around the world. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyone's safety, security and privacy,"" Andrews said in a brief statement on her Twitter feed.Andrews testified for two days during the trial, saying that since the video was seen by millions of people, she experienced serious mental injury, including depression, crying spells and sleeplessness.Her lawyers argued that the hotel was negligent and could have prevented the incident.The video was taken by Michael David Barrett, who pleaded guilty in 2009 to stalking Andrews and making the video. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison.Barrett asked the hotel to put him in a room next to Andrews' after an employee confirmed to him that she was staying there on a certain date. He rigged a peep hole to shoot the video of Andrews while she was changing.Lawyers for the hotel argued that the responsibility was solely Barrett's and there was no way the hotel could have foreseen what he did.The parties who were found liable were West End Hotel Partners, the investment group that owned the Nashville Marriott, and the operating company of the hotel at the time, Windsor Capital Group. Marriott International was originally named in Andrews' lawsuit, but the judge removed it.The jury found that the hotel is liable for 49 percent of the $55 million in damages, or $26.95 million, while Barrett is liable for 51 percent of the damages, equivalent to $28.05 million.",sports
"Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova, the highest-paid woman in sports, said on Monday that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open due to a substance she has been taking for 10 years for health issues.The 28-year-old Sharapova, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said.She is the seventh athlete in a month to test positive for meldonium, which is used to treat diabetes and low magnesium, and was only banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency as of Jan. 1.""I made a huge mistake. I let my fans down and I let the sport down,"" said Sharapova, a teenage tennis prodigy who became the third-youngest Wimbledon champion. ""I take full responsibility for it.""""I know that with this I face consequences and I don't want to end my career this way. I really hope that I will be given another chance to play this game,"" former world No.1 Sharapova told a news conference in a downtown Los Angeles hotel.The ITF's anti-doping program calls for a four-year suspension for a positive test, but that ban can be reduced in various circumstances, such as for first-time offences or if the player shows no significant fault or negligence. If a player bears no fault or negligence, there is no suspension.According to Forbes, she earned $29.5 million in 2015, mostly from endorsements.Sharapova said her family doctor had been giving her mildronate, which is also called meldonium, for 10 years after she frequently became sick, had irregular EKG results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.""It is very important for you to understand that for 10 years this medicine was not on WADA's banned list and I had been legally taking the medicine. But on January the first, the rules have changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance.""The World Anti-Doping Agency, or WADA, declined to comment until ITF issues a final decision.Meldonium is used to treat chest pain and heart attacks among other conditions, but some researchers have linked it to increased athletic performance and endurance. It is listed by WADA among its prohibited metabolic modulators, along with insulin, and some researchers say it can also help recovery.It is not approved in the United States but is available in Russia, Latvia and other countries in that region. Over the past month, Russian cyclist Eduard Vorganov, Russian figure skater Ekaterina Bobrova and Ethiopia-born athletes Endeshaw Negesse and Abeba Aregawi and Ukraine biathletes Olga Abramova and Artem Tyshchenko have all tested positive for meldonium.Sharapova is the most prominent tennis player to test positive for a banned substance in recent years.",sports

"South Africa staged a sensational comeback in defence of a below-par total to claim a first T20 series win over West Indies and sound a warning ahead of the World T20.South Africa's victory came less than three weeks after they beat England for the first time in a T20 and illustrated the progress the team has made since September 2014, when they were beaten 4-0 by England.West Indies, who have not lost a series in the same period of time, will be disappointed with their failure to complete a straightforward chase, especially as they were well on course.They had reached 81 for 3 in the 15th over and even though their captain Stafanie Taylor had been bowled around her legs by Dane van Niekerk, they had their other stalwart Deandra Dottin on hand.Dottin seemed to be striking the ball better than any of her team-mates but when she attempted a loft over long-on, she mistimed to spark a collapse. South Africa took four more wickets in the next 18 balls and then squeezed at the end to pull off a remarkable win.South Africa recovered from an early blow when Shamilia Connell had Trisha Chetty caught at slip and rebuilt cautiously through van Niekerk was joined and Mignon du Preez.The pair found the boundary just five times but rotated strike well to score at more than a run-a-ball and put on 48 for the second wicket. When van Niekerk was bowled as she tried to slog sweep Taylor over midwicket, and with the run-rate stagnating, du Preez took it on herself to try and force the pace. She managed only to gift a catch to short midwicket.Marizanne Kapp and Lizelle Lee also found it heavy going but with South Africa yet to reach 100 and only two overs left, they took some risks. Lee was the only batsman to clear the boundary and her efforts at the end gave South Africa something to defend but when West Indies knocked off the first 14 runs inside two overs, they would not have expected to be successful.Moseline Daniels had Kycia Knight trapped lbw to provide some early hope but that only brought Taylor to the crease. She tried to end matters quickly with her aggressive approach and when she was bowled, Dottin took over. It was only when Dottin was caught that South Africa fought back.Kyshona Knight departed soon after Dottin, sharp fielding resulted in the run-outs of Shermaine Campbell and Shaquana Quintyne and Shabnim Ismail took a good catch off her own bowling to give South Africa belief. Daniels and Ismail bowled tightly at the end and South Africa's fielders were on high alert to deny West Indies.",sports

"While Maria Sharapovas fellow players were shocked by the Russians announcement that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open, most of them felt the ""huge mistake"" could have been avoided.World number three Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland described it as ""a very sad day for tennis"" but expressed the views of many by saying it was down to every player, via their doctor, to check whether prescribed medications were legal.Five-times grand slam champion Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, which some researchers have linked to increased athletic performance and endurance, after failing by her own admission to realise that it had been outlawed since Jan.1.""I dont check those emails,"" Radwanska told reporters on Wednesday about receiving notification of which substances and medications were on the banned list before the start of every year.""That is what my doctor is doing and my agent.

"The World Twenty20 has provided a stage for Asian sides to flourish in its short history and host India's scintillating form leading up to the tournament will only fuel local hopes that the trend will continue.India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament, while the 2010 final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia.Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India, who won the 50-over World Cup at home in 2011, as favourites to add a second World Twenty20 title to their cabinet and given the side's run of form, it is hardly surprising.Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men have won 10 of the 11 Twenty20 contests they have played this year, including a 3-0 win in Australia, and have looked supremely balanced with their often-soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite.The only worry for India's fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on April 3.While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble-free build up to the tournament, it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka.Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arguably have the most potent pace attack with left-arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five-year spot-fixing ban.But Shahid Afridi's men have had troubles with their top-order, prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue change for the highly charged India match will not have helped matters.Defending champions Sri Lanka have failed to adequately replace retired batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene after their 2014 World Twenty20 triumph and were forced to install Angelo Mathews as their new captain this week.The island nation have lost recent series against New Zealand, India and a woeful Asia Cup display led to the sacking of the entire selection panel.The team and their supporters will keep their fingers crossed on the fitness of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga, who relinquished the captaincy due to the slow recovery of his injured knee but insists he can still play a part.AUSTRALIA'S T20 CONUNDRUMAustralia will look to end their lack of success in the format and add the T20 title to their 50-over World Cup triumph on home soil last year, banking on their explosive batting line-up to make up for the lack of a potent spinner.They have not left anything to chance though, replacing Aaron Finch with test and one-day international skipper Steve Smith to lead the side, who have had a number of players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League (IPL) over the years.Another side hoping the experience of playing in the IPL will come in handy for their players will be South Africa, who once again will be determined to shed their 'chokers' tag at another global championship.AB de Villiers, believed by most to be the most destructive batsman in world cricket, has often entertained crowds in India during the IPL with his 360 degree batting and South Africa will hope the 32-year-old can end their wait for a World Cup title.FEARLESS ENGLANDJos Buttler, Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan will believe they can be match de Villiers' pyrotechnics for England but the 2010 champions' bowling attack appears short of experience.They also have a powerful striker in Ben Stokes and the dependable Joe Root with the willow but it is to be seen if the batting can gloss over their bowling shortcomings.Fellow contenders New Zealand may have a few psychological issues to resolve if they are to overcome their tendency to come up short on the big stage.Their preparations have been overshadowed by the recent death of former captain Martin Crowe while the retirement of Brendon McCullum has robbed them of an exceptional reader of the game with unbridled batting firepower.Darren Sammy will also have to inspire an understrength West Indies team, who just weeks ago were planning to boycott the tournament over a contractual dispute, if the 2012 champions are to stand any chance of winning a second title.",sports

By the time he began the final over, Ireland were still 20 short, and he demolished the stumps of Max Sorensen and George Dockrell to ensure there was no monkey business.Both sides were already eliminated but Netherlands were happy to get the consolation win..Only one Ireland player was allowed to bowl two overs and Dockrell's left-arm spin proved to be a wise choice, registering 3 for 7, and producing catching opportunities from three of his first five balls, two of which were taken. Seven dot balls out of 12, including an over in the Powerplay, was an astounding effort that might have brought victory.Dockrell found turn all the same as Netherlands' batsmen floundered against him. Tom Cooper slogged his third ball to mid-on, affording the opportunity to prey upon Roelof van der Merwe who was promoted to No. 3.It did not work out for van der Merwe. Twice, he slogged Dockrell's left-arm spin to the legside. Kevin O'Brien spilled the first - a slice to long-off and a grimace from O'Brien as he landed heavily, but van der Merwe's next attempt was entirely bungled and he fell off the cue end at short third man.The coup de grace came in Dockrell's second over when his turn outdid Wesley Barresi as he came down the pitch, leaving Niall O'Brien with a simple stumping.Stephan Myburgh was dropped on 9 by Paul Stirling at deep midwicket but was still restrict to 27 from 18 balls. When he was run out against the penultimate ball, the damage had been limited. Dockrell bowled only one ball at him - the first ball of his spell - and got away with a leg bye off his waist.Stirling addressed Ireland's chase when he twice walked across his stumps in Tim van der Gugten's first over to flick him over fine leg for six. But Seelaar's thrilling intervention changed the complexion of the game and Stirling fell to the next ball, his ramp shot was collected at third man.At 28.3 off 2.3, Ireland had opportunity even in a six-over game for a settling period, but their plight worsened when Gary Wilson and Stuart Poynter departed against van der Merwe within three balls - Wilson falling to a reverse sweep, Poynton skying a rustic slog.With 25 needed from two, and only five wickets remaining, Netherlands were suddenly favourites. A fine penultimate over from Mudassar Bukhari meant 20 were needed off the last. They never got close.",sports

Javeria was immediately stretchered off the field and taken to a nearby hospital. Javeria underwent a CT scan, and is understood to now be conscious.Sidra Ameen and Bismah Maroof steadied the innings with a patient 40-run stand, but three quick blows from Mohammed swung the contest decisively West Indies way.

Im fit and strong to play, Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday.Steyn, who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems, has seen an improvement in South Africas limited-overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada, Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris.When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence, Steyn said.I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls.It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team, even in that two month gap.South Africa play their opening two World Twenty20 matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam-friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur, which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday.Ive always said that I can bowl on any track, Steyn said.I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning. The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground, especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground.As a seamer I back myself. I can bowl fast cutters, its difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when its coming at 140 or 145 and is gripping and stopping.",sports
"India's cricket team is undoubtedly, indisputably, unarguably, and by a massive distance, better than Pakistan's cricket team. At football.It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams' training sessions on the eve of their World T20 clash at the Eden Gardens. If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large, inflated ball, India would lose no sleep over it.It is, instead, a cricket match. And not just any cricket match. It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it. And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah-ul-Haq.It is an India-Pakistan clash at a World tournament, and it will come with the inevitable trappings. Famous people will sing national anthems. Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance. Sachin Tendulkar will be there. So will Imran Khan. And Sunil Gavaskar. And Wasim Akram. And Kapil Dev. And Inzamam-ul-Haq.In the middle of all this, India and Pakistan, the cricket teams, will try and tune out the constant swirl of India-Pakistan.R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre-match conference on Friday, in a packed and insufficiently air-conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich.""This rivalry is huge,"" he said. ""It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is. It's probably bigger than the Ashes is. As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go, I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket. It's more of a border rivalry, they want to get one up on each other.""So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage. As far as people are concerned, they put their emotions into it. For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can.""It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events. In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20, they have never lost. It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides, but on this occasion India are under more of it, given that they are playing at home, and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one. Over recent years, Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India, and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh.""History can change, too,"" Waqar Younis, Pakistan's head coach, said. ""We are confident, a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also. They will be under a lot of pressure. We have to take it positively. We have won the last match, so there are lots of things going in our favour, hopefully. Yes, there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed.""In all the previous games, the pressure was on Pakistani team. This is the first time that the pressure is more on India - not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament. I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure. I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that.""India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night, but only had an optional training session - which only Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended - on Thursday. Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve. Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand, and not put themselves under too much pressure.""I think it was more about trying and relaxing,"" he said. ""It had nothing to do with who we are playing, what game we are playing and all that. We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game. The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising.""What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice, try and overdo everything, and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be. That's the idea behind it.""India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset, with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle-order trio of Yuvraj Singh, MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting. Pakistan - after their unconvincing footballing warm-up - had a more traditional nets session, with the fast bowlers coming off their full run-ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries.Two training philosophies, neither definitely better or worse than the other, both geared to the same end: to keep minds focused on bat and ball, to tune out the crowds and the last-minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build-up. As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament, ""On the field is the safest and quietest place for you"". And until they actually get on the field, the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket. It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young-again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout.",sports
"Australia began their title defence with a six-wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur. It was vice-captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end, after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over.South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat. Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood, indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6. As hard as they tried, defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title.Eventually, the batting meltdown played a big part in the result, as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52-run fifth-wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare.South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72-run opening stand with Trisha Chetty, before Australia strangulated them.While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace, Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect. Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100-run mark.Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner. Alyssa Healy walked across to flick, only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired-up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff. Perry bottom-edged a cut to the wicketkeeper, while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures.Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket. But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket. When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped, the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4, needing 50 off 47 balls.Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs. Once within striking distance, the feared white-ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts, to convert a tricky chase into a cruise.",sports
"England defeated South Africa by two wickets in a high-scoring World Twenty20 Super Ten Group One match which yielded a total of 459 runs for the loss of 12 wickets in 39.4 overs here at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday night.Chasing a mammoth total of 230, England completed their first victory in the tournament with two balls remaining.England openers Jason Roy and Alex Hales laid the foundation of the win with a 48-run first wicket partnership and later Joe Root led the assault, guiding with an aggressive innings of 83 in 44 balls, laced with four towering sixes and six fours.When Root departed England needed only 11 runs from ten balls but they lost two more wickets in a bid to take the winning single.This was the second-highest successful chase in T20 internationals and the highest in World T20 history.South Africas pacers Kyle Abbott and Kagiso Rabada claimed three and two wickets but conceded 41 and 50 runs, respectively.Earlier, three brilliant half-centuries from Hashim Amla, Quinton de Kock and Jean-Paul Duminy helped South Africa post 229 for four.Amla made 58 off 31 balls and de Kock scored 52 off 24 balls, both hitting three sixes and seven fours each.

"Former cricket stars on Friday pinned hopes on skipper Shahid Afridi to repeat his all-round skills for the second time when Pakistan take on traditional rivals India in the eagerly awaited clash of the World Twenty20 as the sun sets on the lush green Eden Gardens of Kolkata.The former cricket greats believed the flamboyant all rounder Shahid Afridi could play a key role in national teams win against their arch foes.Afridi, who has been under fire after Pakistan s poor performance in the Asia Cup T20, played superbly both with the bat and ball in national teams win against Bangladesh in their opening match of ongoing T20 World Cup on Wednesday.Batting legend Javed Miandad said he wants Afridi to repeat his heroics of Bangladesh match when time comes for Saturdays encounter.Afridi has to bat up in the order.

Sports should not be a war as the world makes fun of us (when we behave this way) Miandad added.Former superstar Wasim Akram said that Pakistan would psychologically be in a better frame of mind in the match against India.Pakistan are going to the game after a convincing win in their opening match. So psychologically they will have an edge over Indians as they suffered defeat in their first match against New Zealand, Wasim said.He also asked Pakistan team to adopt an attacking strategy against Indians. If Pakistan manage to get a couple of wickets in the power play session, they will be in a position to push India to the back foot, the former captain said.Former Test Captain Aamir Sohail says bowlers would have to work hard in the high profile World Twenty20 encounter.If India wins the toss and bats first, our bowlers will have to take early wickets in order to restrict the Indian batsmen to a low total.But if our batsmen are put to bat first, then they will have to take the responsibility and show some real performance like they did in the match against Bangladesh, said he.Sohail said: In case India prepares a flat pitch, Pakistan will have an edge over the arch rivals.But if they prepare a turning pitch, then India will have an upper handTest Skipper Misbah ul Haq said Pakistan could win the WorldTwenty20, if Shahid Afridi performs consistently in the whole tournament.Afridi needs to fire constantly if Pakistan wants to salvage a chance of clinching the title once again.If Afridi keeps going like this, Pakistan can win the World T20, he said.",sports
"Suzie Bates' swift 60-ball 82 and her 104-run partnership with Sophie Devine for the second wicket set the base for New Zealand Women's massive 93-run win over Ireland Women in the World T20 match in Mohali.New Zealand got off to a blistering start after opting to bat, as opener Rachel Priest struck three fours in the first over before falling to medium-pacer Amy Kenealy in the second over.The wicket brought Bates and Devine together at the crease, and the pair built on the early momentum in their century stand. By the end of the Powerplay, New Zealand were 48 for one and except for a couple of quiet overs, the pair found the boundary with ease.Devine fell in the 15th over to Isobel Joyce, after a 34-ball 47, and Bates then propelled the score past 150.The New Zealand captain struck two successive sixes off Kim Garth in the penultimate over before falling for 82; her knock also included seven fours.She became the fourth player to score more than 2000 runs in women's T20I cricket and is second on the list of highest run-getters with 2063 runs, ahead of Sarah Taylor and Stafanie Taylor.Ireland's chase simply failed to get off the blocks. They lost two wickets within the first four overs for a score of 16 and by the tenth over had reached only 34 for 3.The required run rate was already more than 14 by that stage and it was only Joyce who showed some resistance with a 33-ball 28, the top score in an Ireland innings that eventually petered out to 84 for 5.Offspinner Leigh Kasperek had economical returns of 1-10 in her four overs while legspinner Erin Bermingham took 2 for 17.",sports

"New Zealand held their nerve to edge out Australia by eight runs in a tense World Twenty20 Group Two match on Friday and move closer to a place in the semi-finals.On a high after beating hosts India in their opening game, New Zealand posted a modest 142-8 before defending the total with disciplined bowling and tight fielding against their trans-Tasman rivals.Australia came into the tournament with an embarrassment of top-order riches and decided to open with Usman Khawaja and Shane Watson.The decision meant no place for Aaron Finch, who was captain of the side barely six weeks ago and is the top-ranked batsman in this format of the game.Khawaja (38) added 44 runs with Shane Watson (13) before Australia suffered a collapse to slump to 66-4 at the halfway mark of their innings.Glenn Maxwell (22) and Mitchell Marsh (24) tried their best but Australia kept losing wickets at regular intervals and needed 19 runs off the final over sent down by Corey Anderson.Anderson dismissed James Faulkner with the first ball to dash Australia's slender hopes of a narrow win as New Zealand rose to the top of the group table.Mitchell McClenaghan justified his selection at the cost of off-spinner Nathan McCullum, claiming figures of 3-17.Earlier, Martin Guptill (39) gave New Zealand a flying start in a 61-run opening stand with skipper Kane Williamson (24) who decided to bat first on a dry track at the picturesque stadium in the north Indian hill station.Guptill greeted Aston Agar by hitting his first two balls out of the ground and a third six off the final ball of the over but Maxwell did an excellent job taking a catch in the deep to send back the dangerous Guptill, then dismissing Williamson with his second delivery and sending back Anderson in his next over.Later, he took another catch to dismiss Luke Ronchi and fired in a bullet throw to run out Mitchell Santner.Grant Elliot struck a quickfire 27 down the order but New Zealand managed only 84 runs in the last 14 overs.<br/> ",sports

"Football's ruling body FIFA said it paid disgraced former president Sepp Blatter 3.63 million Swiss francs ($3.8 million) last year, publishing his salary for the first time under new governance regulations.FIFA also announced it lost $122 million in 2015, its first deficit since 2002, attributing that mainly to the costs of battling the worst graft scandal in its history.In particular, FIFA's legal fees rose from $31.29 million in 2014 to $61.49 million while its reserves dropped from $1.52 billion to $1.34 billion.""The unprecedented events that occurred in 2015 have impacted upon FIFA's financial results, however the organisation's healthy reserves have allowed it to weather the storm,"" the Swiss-based federation said in a statement.Several dozen officials, including former members of FIFA's executive committee, have been indicted in the United States while Blatter has been banned for six years by the ruling body's ethics committee.FIFA said Blatter's former secretary general Jerome Valcke, banned for 12 years, was paid 2.12 million Swiss francs last year. The aggregate remuneration of key management personnel was $27.9 million.Blatter had been FIFA president since 1998 and his salary had long been the subject of speculation. It was finally published on Thursday under new rules which were passed in February in an attempt to make FIFA more transparent.FIFA said it calculated Blatter and Valcke's payments on the advice of an ""independent, external company that specialises in HR and compensation issues.""Despite the troubles, FIFA said it had revised its projected revenue for the 2015-2018 cycle upwards from $5 billion to $5.65 billion, with projected investments amounting to $5.55 billion.Last year, Valcke, while still secretary general, admitted that FIFA was having trouble in negotiating new sponsorship deals because of its battered reputation.New FIFA president Gianni Infantino, whose salary has not been revealed, made ambitious promises during his election campaign to increase spending on football development around the world.""With the recently approved reforms, I believe that we have turned a corner and that FIFA is poised to emerge stronger than ever,"" said Infantino.""During my presidency, I pledge to make this happen and to lead FIFA into a brighter and more sustainable future so that we can all return our full focus to football.""""We saw in 2015 that FIFA's competitions  such as the FIFA Women's World Cup  remain an incredible opportunity for us to promote the game and to raise the funds we need to fulfil our core mission of football development.""During the electoral campaign, two of Infantino's rivals said that his plans were not financially viable and could wipe out FIFA's reserves.Revenue from World Cup sponsors dropped from $131 million to $44.5 million in 2015 after contracts with Johnson &amp; Johnson, Castrol and Continental expired at the end of 2014.However, revenue from FIFA's top tier partners increased from $177.1 million to $180 million.FIFA, which said it employed an average of 582 people throughout 2015, spent $92.1 million on personnel, compared to $115.28 million the year before.",sports

"Heavy rain hit Kolkata ahead of the mother of all cricket match --- Pakistan-India clash in the ICC World Twenty20 championship here at Eden Gardens today (Saturday), Indian media reported.At one point media reports suggested, the clash may be marred by rain.

"Serena Williams overcame a sluggish start to forge past Agnieszka Radwanska and move into the final of the BNP Paribas Open with a 6-4 7-6(1) victory on Friday.The world number one was 4-2 down in the opening set and not moving freely in their semi-final at Indian Wells, before the American began to find her rhythm to claim four straight games and control of the battle.Williams continued her run in the second set to win the opening three games before her Polish opponent fought back.Radwanska displayed the kind of tennis that will see her rise to number two in the world rankings on Monday, rallying to win the next three games to get the set back on serve.The Pole even had a chance to win just her second career set against Williams when she broke the American to lead 6-5, but could not close out on serve.Williams then snuffed out any hopes Radwanska had of claiming a first victory against the American, winning seven straight points to take the tiebreaker 7-1 and improve to 10-0 in their head-to-head battles.""I think it was really good for me to have a match like that and I think that's the reason Aga is doing so well, because she never gave up,"" Williams told reporters.""I was up so much in the second and she just came back and was determined more than ever, so it was really good to play well against her tonight.""I could have played three sets but I figured I should at least do 1000 percent right now.

"South Africa survived a spirited Afghanistan chase to defend a 200-plus score and get their World Twenty20 campaign back on track.Chris Morris and Imran Tahir squeezed through the middle period to ensure AB de Villiers' quickfire 64 was not in vain, he took 29 runs off Rashid Khan, which ended up being the major difference between the two sides.In the end, South Africa will be relieved that they were able to defend their total, but disappointed that the margin of victory was not bigger. They tightened up on their discipline in the field but still gave away more extras than their opposition - six wides compared to two from Afghanistan - and did not show the kind of killer instinct that they will need later in the tournament.They also suffered an injury concern. JP Duminy left the field four balls into Afghanistan's chase with a hamstring strain and was unable to take any further part in the match. Duminy has only just found form again and his availability will be important for the rest of the World T20.Quinton de Kock picked up from where he left off two days ago and dominated the opening passages of play. Hashim Amla may have wanted to catch up but after one four, gifted a catch to Asghar Stanikzai at mid-off.South Africa held de Villiers back and sent in Faf du Plessis at No.3. The strategy worked. Du Plessis took on the spin from Mohammad Nabi while de Kock continued to attack in the Powerplay. South Africa finished it on 66 for 1 and 60 of those runs came in boundaries.When the fielding restrictions were lifted, Rashid put the brakes on with the first boundary-less over of the innings, but du Plessis did not want things to slow down too much. He picked up the pace before being run-out and de Villiers was soon at the crease.Afghanistan were not under threat immediately while de Villiers settled in and de Kock nicked off. After conceding just 19 runs in three overs after the halfway stage of the South African innings, Afghanistan might have been hopeful of pulling South Africa even further back. But Duminy and de Villiers were wise to the need to accelerate and began to push for runs.It was up to David Miller to take them to 200 after de Villiers was dismissed. Twenty runs off the final over ensured South Africa had a second straight 200-plus score.However, Mohammad Shahzad threatened to gun down that total all by himself. He began fearlessly against Kagiso Rabada and Kyle Abbott and plundered 32 runs off the first two overs. His partner Noor Ali Zadran did not face a ball until the third over and then, it was only to return the strike to Shahzad.Morris was brought on in the fourth over and showed improvement from previous performances. He started by holding his length back but then steamed in with a delivery just under 150kph - full and straightening - which splayed Shahzad's stumps.Asghar Stanikzai and was caught behind in Morris' next over but Gulbadin Naib kept Afghanistan in it and targeted David Wiese, South Africa's replacement for Steyn. Afghanistan reached 10 overs on 103 for 2, 11 runs ahead of where South Africa were at the same stage. Then, Gulbadin was caught behind, Noor Ali was stumped, and Afghanistan were wobbling, still needing 100 runs off eight overs. Their chase was over then and South Africa had the chance to drill home an advantage.Instead, they allowed Afghanistan to drag it out. Abbott and Morris got the yorker right more often than they did in previous matches and Rabada managed one at the end, but South Africa will not feel it was a complete performance by any means.

"Pakistan did all they could to get their World Twenty20 match against India moved to Kolkata, even threatening to withdraw, but poor selection and the hosts all-round superiority left them wishing they had not bothered to turn up at all.The most anticipated match of the tournament between the neighbours was shifted to Eden Gardens at the last moment over security concerns at the original venue at Dharamsala.Pakistan repeatedly emphasised Indias morale-sapping loss in the opener against New Zealand was an advantage for them and they were even more confident of breaking their jinx of losing every World Cup match between the bitter rivals.Their decision to play four fast bowlers against India reflected an approach more suited to the 1980s West Indies side and dropping spinner Imad Wasim at the expense of a paceman underlined their failure to read the surface.Asked to bat in the rain-shortened Group Two match, the 2009 champions were largely subdued once off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin got the new ball to turn viciously.Doubts seemed to creep into Pakistans minds regarding what would be a decent target to set India, who folded for 79 against the Kiwis on a turning track while chasing 127 in their opener, and the innings never gained momentum until the death overs.MEAGRE TOTAL""There are few areas we need to improve, specially our batting,"" said Shoaib Malik, who top-scored with a 26 for Pakistan.""Even though it was a tough pitch to bat on, I believe we could have set a higher target.""In the end, Pakistan could only manage a meagre 118 for five in their 18 overs, nowhere near enough without the bowling depth New Zealand could draw upon in Nagpur when their spinners picked up nine of 10 wickets to stun India.India did suffer a minor wobble though, slumping to 23-3 after Mohammad Sami dismissed Shikhar Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive deliveries in the fifth over to silence the 60,000 crowd at Eden Gardens as well as the millions watching on TV.However, Indias batting mainstay Virat Kohli hit a prudent 55 not out to calm the nerves and showed why he is considered one of the worlds best.The right-hander, who averages almost 85 in T20s against Pakistan, was aided by the fact that he did not have to face too many deliveries from Mohammad Amir, whose opening spell of 1-3 ran shivers down Indias spines.The left-arm paceman was not brought back on by Shahid Afridi until India were nearing victory and the leg-spinning skipper, who lacks the guile to turn the ball effectively, was unable to stem the flow of runs himself.As the pressure lifted, India were easily able to maintain their utter dominance of Pakistan in World Cup events, adding a fifth World Twenty20 victory to the six triumphs in the 50-over format.",sports

"Australia survived another middle-order collapse to beat Bangladesh by three wickets in the World Twenty20 Super 10 on Monday to get their campaign up and running.Both teams were looking to bounce back from losing their opening Group Two games, Australia skipper Steve Smith winning the toss and choosing to field.Smiths men picked up wickets at regular intervals to restrict Bangladesh to a modest 156 for five despite a late flurry by Mahmudullah who hit seven fours in an unbeaten 49.Leg-spinner Adam Zampa (3-23) and all-rounder Shane Watson (2-31) were the pick of the bowlers.Openers Usman Khawaja (58) and Watson (21) then got Australia off to a good start, sharing a stand of 62 in 44 deliveries before the latter was run out.Khawaja was bowled by Al-Amin Hossain in the 14th over having struck seven fours and a six in a 45-ball knock that gave Australia a solid platform, although they had the same sort of middle-order slump they suffered in the first game against New Zealand.Smith, out for six against the Kiwis, was bowled by Mustafizur Rahman for 14.David Warner (17) was next to fall and was soon followed by Mitchell Marsh (six).Glenn Maxwell then scored a brisk 26 before being stumped by Mushfiqur Rahim off left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan.All-rounder John Hastings, brought in by Australia for left-arm spinner Ashton Agar, was dropped on nought by Hossain and finally went for three when he was caught at mid-wicket by Soumya Sarkar.By then Australia needed five runs off the last two overs and James Faulkner and Peter Nevill saw them through to a far-from-convincing win that lifted them to third in the group behind New Zealand and Pakistan but ahead of India.Bangladesh, who are bottom, have a mountain to climb to reach the semi-finals.",sports

Atapattu then brought herself into the attack in the defence of 114 and her second over resulted in two wickets.

"Indian great Sachin Tendulkar remains the gold standard of batting in the post-Bradman era but Virat Kohlis latest masterclass in Sundays World Twenty20 shootout against Australia has prompted comparisons with his famous compatriot.Not for the first time in the tournament, it took Kohlis masterly knock to get India across the line in a virtual quarter-final against the reigning 50-overs world champions.Kohli remained unbeaten after a sublime 82, burnishing his reputation as arguably the best chaser in limited-overs cricket with a knock that reminded many of Tendulkars 143 against Australia in a 1998 one-dayer at Sharjah dubbed ""desert storm"".Shane Warne was at the receiving end of Tendulkars wrath in that match and 18 years since the contest, the Australian spin great saw Tendulkars shadow in Kohlis latest knock.""Great knock by @imVkohli Reminded me of one of your many special innings buddy,"" Warne tweeted to his great rival Tendulkar after Kohli secured India a place in the semi-finals on Sunday.Kohli bejewelled his knock with two sixes and nine boundaries and sprinted tirelessly between wickets in a flawless display of limited overs batting under tremendous pressure.He middled every ball, timed his shots with surgical precision and found gaps with eerie regularity to stamp his class.""Of the modern players, Ive always thought that Brian Lara was the best placer of the ball,"" former Australia captain Ian Chappell said.

"England skipper Eoin Morgan would like to believe his team peaked at the right time at the ongoing World Twenty20 while New Zealand were slightly premature going into Wednesdays semi-final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium.Kane Williamson and his Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India, winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi-finals as the tournaments only unbeaten team.For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with, Englands passage proved bumpier.Even before they could soak in the atmosphere, England were blown away by a Chris Gayle century in their tournament opener against West Indies in Mumbai.Joe Root sparked their recovery in the 230-run chase against South Africa but the narrow victory against Afghanistans modest resources exposed their frailties against spin bowling.They looked a significantly better side, however, in Saturdays 10-run win against champions Sri Lanka.Jos Buttler underlined his limited overs worth with a belligerent fifty, the pacemen made regular inroads, Ben Stokes delivered a tidy final over and the team held their nerve to secure a victory that seemed to tick most of the boxes.""In these tight tournaments you cant get through to the semis unless you are playing good cricket, and thats what we set out to do to give ourselves a chance,"" coach Trevor Bayliss said.""But its about peaking at the right time.I wouldnt say weve played the perfect game yet -- coaches are always looking for that absolutely perfect game, I dont think its ever been played -- but its what any team is striving to do.""Having played their last two games at Kotla, England would also hope to cash in on their familiarity with the venue in contrast to their opponents who were on a mini-tour of India playing each of their four group games at different venues.KIWI ADAPTABILITYThe trouble for England, however, is that New Zealand won all of them as the team, finalists in last years 50-over World Cup, strive to shed the tag of being crickets perennial bridesmaid.Leading from the front, Williamson has also displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this.New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener, picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India, renowned for their batsmens comfort against the turning ball, in their own game.Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result, his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille.Left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg-spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis, claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches.And if Williamson has noticed Englands struggle against Afghanistans slow bowlers, the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullums control and accuracy in a three-pronged spin attack.As demonstrated by Martin Guptill, the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart-warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations.""It hasnt been the wham, bam...sort of way that T20 cricket has been,"" batting coach Craig McMillan said after the victory against Bangladesh in their last group match.""They have had to assess it...and have done a really good job of putting the runs on the board to give the bowlers something to work with.""",sports

"England won the toss and elected to bowl against New Zealand in the first semi-final in World T20 here at Feroz Shah Kotla ground on Wednesday.New Zealand were facing their fifth different venue in as many matches and were they to reach the final they would do so without chasing at any time in the tournament.Expectations of a slightly quicker surface in Delhi than New Zealand had normally encountered, with limited spin, led them to include the pace of Adam Milne ahead of the offspin of Nathan McCullum - reverting to the XI which saw off Australia in Dharamsala.Eoin Morgan's decision to bowl was influenced not just by England's preference for chasing but the belief that evening dew in the second innings might tilt conditions a little in their favour. New Zealand's surprise package - the spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi - still lay in wait.The pitch appeared to have a little grass, but given the venue's history that did not mean there would be much response for bowlers of any type. England's two previous games, against Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, had been played on slowish surfaces, one dry and slow, one damper and a little quicker, but neither offered much turn.Almost no one would have expected New Zealand to leave both Trent Boult and Tim Southee out for the entire group stage, yet the semi-final had arrived and they were excluded once more.England: Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (captain), Jos Buttler (wk), Ben Stokes, Moeen Ali, Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan, David Willey, Liam PlunkettNew Zealand: Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson (captain), Colin Munro, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Corey Anderson, Luke Ronchi (wk), Mitchell Santner, Adam Milne, Ish Sodhi, Mitchell McClenaghan",sports

"The Meg Lanning-led Australia Women side won the bragging rights over England Women, who stumbled to yet another defeat to their arch-rivals in a knockout clash. It left Australia eyeing a delicious prospect of pitching for their fourth successive Women's World T20 title come Sunday.Lanning's 50-ball 55 on a slow Feroz Shah Kotla deck was the cornerstone to Australia's 132 for 6.England, who needed to achieve the highest successful run chase in the tournament to have a crack at their second title, choked despite having the target well within touching distance.They imploded with a combination of nerves and reckless shots. Katherine Brunt, who had a forgettable day with the ball, muscled a six and four to bring the equation down to 17 off 10 deliveries before Australia's killer instinct prevailed; England agonisingly falling short by five runs.England came out all attacking in their chase, and also benefitted from some luck as a diving Beth Mooney put down a tough chance offered by Tammy Beaumont at mid-off in the fourth over.Charlotte Edwards, who started slowly, lent the artistic touch to the innings, before she chipped a catch to cover, against the run of play.

"The second World Twenty20 semi-final is likely to hinge on who emerges on top in the battle between the big-hitting West Indian batsmen and Indias wily spinners when the former champions clash at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.India, the worlds top-ranked side in the shortest format, arrived at the sixth edition of the tournament with 10 wins from 11 matches in 2016 and were considered overwhelming favourites by fans, opposing captains and bookmakers alike.But while an opening Super 10 stage defeat to New Zealand, who reached the semi-finals unbeaten, was a wake-up call, the home sides credentials came into question in a one-run win over Bangladesh, who lost three wickets in the last three balls.Virat Kohlis wide blade was then called on to see off a stiff challenge from 50-over world champions Australia in a winner-takes-all contest to reach the last four, his masterclass glossing over some major batting flaws for the 2007 champions.Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have failed to build a solid foundation for the hosts and their opening stands of five, 14, 42 and 23 have put pressure on the middle and lower order to provide a bulk of the scoring.Left-hander Suresh Rainas scores of one, zero, 30 and 10 have not been overly helpful either, and calls for the number four batsmans omission from the team have only gained momentum.Yuvraj Singhs ankle injury in the win over Australia could open the door for Ajinkya Rahane to play at his home ground in Mumbai but the right-hander may be a little rusty, having not been involved in an international match for more than a month.""You cant rely on one batsman, yes the others have contributed, but still at the same time, if we can do a bit more with the bat at the top of the order and the middle overs, I think we will feel the pressure slightly less,"" India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the Australia triumph.""Also, it will be good, because still we feel we are batting at 65 percent, barring Virat (Kohli).""CAPTAIN COOLDhoni faces the prospect of lifting a third World Cup for India after leading them in 2007 and again for the 50-overs title in 2011, the wicketkeeper lauded for his exceptional calmness and savvy against Bangladesh as India stole victory.A win on Thursday will take India to a third final in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni after they went down to South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh.The strong form of his spinners and accuracy of pacemen Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah in the death overs will give Dhoni hope of taming the West Indies batsmen on a surface that has done little to help the bowlers in three matches.South Africa saw a 230-run target chased down by England, who were on the receiving end of Chris Gayles assault when they failed to defend a score of 182.At the same ground, Afghanistan gave South Africa a scare while chasing 209 until they lost too many wickets in the second half of the innings on a surface offering little respite for the bowlers at a ground with relatively short boundaries.Afghanistan also inflicted the only Super 10 defeat on West Indies with their spinners finding a way to restrict their powerful batsmen in Nagpur.The 2012 champions rested Gayle for that game and a hamstring injury to Andre Fletcher, who has since been ruled out of the tournament and replaced by Lendl Simmons, hampered their chase further.But the inability to chase down a modest 124 would have not gone unnoticed and skipper Darren Sammy is hoping it was just a one-off and not a sign of inconsistency.""We have to leave this game in Nagpur,"" Sammy said.""Well leave this game here and see it as the blip in the tournament.""Now we have two knockouts to play. Two more steps.""",sports

"Aggressive opening batsman Chris Gayle usually hogs the headlines but West Indies' advance to the World Twenty20 final against England has shown they are by no means a one-man band, according to batsman Lendl Simmons.Gayle scored an unbeaten century in the Caribbean side's first pool match against England, which set up their successful run chase of 183, reaching the target with 11 balls to spare in Mumbai. Since then, he has scored nine further runs.He was dismissed for five in the semi-final against India before Simmons smashed 82 from 51 balls, while Andre Russell scored 43 from 20 to guide their side into Sunday's showdown with Eoin Morgan's team in Kolkata on Sunday.""I think England will certainly be aware that it's not a one-man show in this team,"" Simmons told reporters.""Chris Gayle didn't get off but we still managed to get over the line and it was a big total.""Even when he didn't perform, we were still able to get up and fight and that shows a lot of character from our players.""The team have needed to rely on their character and collective will after a turbulent few months in which they have been pilloried for their performances in test matches and one day internationals.They have also been galvanised by yet another bitter pay dispute with their board, who less than two months ago threatened to send a second string side to the tournament in India unless the squad accepted their offer.Since Gayle's blistering start to the tournament, others have assumed the mantle of trying to chase down the totals they have been set in all five games.Andre Fletcher scored 84 not out in their seven-wicket win over Sri Lanka, while Johnson Charles (32) and Marlon Samuels (43) saw them to a three-wicket win over South Africa.""Every one of our players are match winners in our team,"" Simmons added.

"The West Indies board has offered talks with its new World Twenty20 champions to defuse a longrunning dispute saying it wants to find ways of ensuring players dont turn their backs on international cricket.The Windies victory in the final in Kolkata on Sunday night was soured by an outburst from skipper Darren Sammy who said it was disappointing the team had received no support from the board before the match.Dave Cameron, the boards president responded by calling the comments inappropriate in a statement that reserved its warmest words for the tournament organisers rather than the victorious players.However, Cameron did offer an olive branch by saying the board would meet players after the end of the Indian Premier League (IPL) next month to persuade them to play for the West Indies rather than opt for lucrative Twenty20 leagues.We want to see how we can find common ground in ensuring that the best players in the region are available for selection for West Indies teams, Cameron said.We are fully aware of the financial rewards on offer in the lucrative international T20 leagues but we believe deeply in the importance of cricket to the people of the region and of West Indies cricket s place in world cricket. It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection.Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards.A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began.Many senior players, such as Chris Gayle, no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year.When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year, Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australias Big Bash T20 tournament.Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes.Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May.We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time, said Cameron. We will also engage the ICC on this so that we protect not only the rich heritage and legacy of West Indies cricket but also its future, he added.",sports
"Waqar Younis has resigned as Pakistan's coach three months before his contract was going to end, and only one day after Shahid Afridi stepped down as the T20 captain. Waqar took the decision after meeting PCB officials in Lahore.The two resignations came after Pakistan's disappointing performances in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh and the World T20 in India. Pakistan won only three games out of the eight they played across the two tournaments and failed to make it beyond the first round. The last series Pakistan won in any format was last October, when they beat England 2-0 in a three-Test series in the UAE. After that, Pakistan lost the ODI and T20 series to England, and then traveled to New Zealand to again lose the T20 and ODI series. They won only two of the 12 limited-overs matches they played in all against England and New Zealand. Pakistan are currently ranked a respectable fourth in Tests, but eighth in ODIs and seventh in T20s in the ICC rankings.Waqar had recently presented a scathing report, after Pakistan's exit from the World T20, in which he criticised the PCB's decision of not giving him a say in the selection process and lambasted Afridi's style of captaincy. The report was an overview of his two-year term as coach and was submitted to PCB chairman Shahryar Khan and to the board's fact-finding committee.A day before submitting that report, Waqar had offered to step down but had said cosmetic changes would be insufficient to solve the deeper issues in Pakistan cricket.It was Waqar's second tenure as coach after he was appointed in May 2014 for a two-year contract. His first stint as head coach was in 2010-11 and he had then resigned citing personal reasons.",sports

Shakib Al Hasan and Morne Morkel, central to their plans last season, were benched.Sunil Narine, who played a stellar role in their title-winning run in 2012 and 2014, was unavailable because of his father's demise. Did it hamper them? It didn't look like, as Andre Russell and Brad Hogg took three wickets apiece to skittle Delhi Daredevils for 98. Robin Uthappa and Gautam Gambhir's 69-run opening then set the tone for a comfortable win with 35 balls to spare.Russell and John Hastings, taking Morkel's place, ran in hard and hit the deck to extract unusual bounce.

Three balls later, Shreyas Iyer was trapped lbw for a duck.Mayank Agarwal and Karun Nair also exited in successive overs as Hastings capped the Powerplay with a wicket maiden. By then, Daredevils were in a familiar spot at 35 for 4. Pawan Negi, who was promoted to No.6, swished and missed balls. He was finally put out of his misery when Hogg had him stumped for a 19-ball 11.IPL debutant Carlos Brathwaite, who fired West Indies to their second World T20 title last week, momentarily broke the shackles with a biff over wide long-on, but was foxed by a skiddy googly from Piyush Chawla two balls later. Sanju Samson was the eighth Daredevils batsman to be dismissed before Hastings made a reappearance to wrap up the innings. Daredevils had slumped to their seventh sub-100 score in IPL, which also happened to be the second-lowest score in the tournament's history at Eden Gardens.The chase was a stroll for Knight Riders, and the onset of dew only made things worse. Zaheer Khan, playing his first competitive game since May 2015, floated flick-me balls in the lower 120kph range to Gambhir's pads and got picked away for three fours in the second over. Uthappa got into his shot-making stride with a brace of straight-driven fours as the hosts raced past 50 in the eighth over.Although Uthappa holed out for 35 in the tenth over against the run of play, Gambhir and Manish Pandey ensured Knight Riders enjoyed a winning start.",sports

"Aaron Finch and Dwayne Bravo helped Gujarat Lions ease into the IPL with a thumping win against Kings XI Punjab in Mohali, the third one-sided affair of the season in three games.Barring the first over, Lions were in total control of the 162 chase after Finch set it up with his first IPL fifty since 2014.Brendon McCullum, fresh off a whirlwind ton in his last Test, danced down the track off Sandeep Sharma in the first over with keeper Wriddhiman Saha standing up.Sandeep, though, anticipated a forward shimmy and bowled the perfect outswinger to leave McCullum stranded. Finch and Suresh Raina then took the attack to the pacers, both capitalizing on loose deliveries along with intermittent swipes.After Raina holed out to mid-on in the sixth over, Finch peppered the boundary with deft touch and exemplary placement, particular behind square on the off side.His 47-ball 74 saw 12 boundaries, and it required a moment of brilliance from the debutant Pardeep Sahu to remove him. Sahu drew Finch forward but the legspinner beat him in flight and loop, as Saha completed his second stumping off the innings.The rest of the innings was a mere formality as Dinesh Karthik accrued his runs in typical fashion, with his sweeps being the most productive.Kings XI were given an ideal start by their openers - M Vijay and Manan Vohra - who saw off the swinging new ball before getting stuck into their work. A blend of crisp drives and flicks earned the pair a fifty-run stand within the Powerplay.The spreading field did not impede Vohra, as he manufactured boundaries with the use of his feet off the spinners.However, momentum shifted rapidly as Ravindra Jadeja struck twice in consecutive overs to remove the openers. Dwayne Bravo undid Glenn Maxwell and David Miller in the space of three balls with contrasting yorkers.Bravo became the first bowler to 300 T20 wickets with his new weapon - the slow, dipping yorker that deceived Miller.Suddenly, debutant Marcus Stoinis and Wriddhiman Saha were left to rebuild a rollicking start. The pair were forced to use the large Mohali pockets to find their runs, but struggled to find the boundaries towards the end. Much of that was down to the efficiency of the Lions bowlers, who executed their yorkers and slower balls.Bravo took two more wickets off consecutive slower balls in the last over, and could have had his best T20 bowling figures had Sarabjit Ladda pouched a skier off the last ball. Just two boundaries and 36 runs were scored off the last five overs, and Kings XI could muster 161.",sports

"Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No. 4 for Mumbai Indians. It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight-ball 20. The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match - Mumbai, by six wickets.McClenaghan's responsibility - under normal circumstances - was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes. Be the wicket-taker at the start and the enforcer at the end. Today, he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm. And he was given the freedom to do so. Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog. His second, third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries. The eighth - a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep - led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum. And Buttler simply ran with it.A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six. The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30. A scoop to the fine leg boundary - which established Buttler's finesse - and two lofted cover drives - which established his power - deflated Knight Riders. Gautam Gambhir, who had taken the record (27) for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night, watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike.When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls, the Mumbai captain, Rohit Sharma, back at his preferred opening position, provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game. Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots - a straight six and a deft glide to third man. He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket, and deposited it at the midwicket boundary.

"Cristiano Ronaldo's fifth Champions League hat-trick inspired Real Madrid to a 3-0 comeback victory over VfL Wolfsburg on Tuesday that clinched a place in the semi-finals for a sixth successive season.The prolific Portuguese got the 10-times European champions, 2-0 down from the first leg, off to a perfect start by tapping in Daniel Carvajal's cross after 16 minutes and heading a second goal less than a minute later from Toni Kroos' corner.Ronaldo capped a 3-2 win on aggregate when he curled in a free kick after 77 minutes, his 16th goal in this season's competition taking him within touching distance of his record of 17 in 2013-14.He also equalled Barcelona rival Lionel Messi's record of five Champions League trebles as he took his goal tally in all competitions this season to 46.""It's a day for celebration,"" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane. ""We won with character, fight and effort and I'm very proud of the players.""The sensation is of a job well done because it wasn't easy. It was a special night...I'm very happy with the players because they did a phenomenal job.""Zidane's only change from the first leg was to replace the much-criticised Danilo at right back with Carvajal.Opposite number Dieter Hecking kept the same lineup that served him so well at the Wolfsburg Arena.GREAT FIGHTBACKSReal have a reputation for staging great fightbacks in Europe but they had not overturned a first-leg deficit in the Champions League since 2002 when Zidane, as a player, helped them beat Bayern Munich 2-0 at the Bernabeu after a 2-1 reverse.The home team's intent was clear when defender Sergio Ramos headed the ball against the crossbar early on and they soon started turning the tie back in their favour.Carvajal vindicated Zidane's decision when he beat Julian Draxler to the ball in midfield before setting up Ronaldo's opening goal.Wolfsburg tried to recover and they missed a couple of chances to get on the scoresheet.The 31-year-old Ronaldo, top scorer this season in La Liga and the Champions League, had different ideas though and he sent the Bernabeu crowd wild with delight by scoring twice more.""It was a fantastic night,"" said Real full back Marcelo. ""The fans were phenomenal and without them we wouldn't have been able to turn the game around.""In the Champions League you have to suffer.

"Royal Challengers Bangalore blasted the first 200-plus score of the tournament in an emphatic 45-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In doing so, they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing.AB de Villiers (82) and Virat Kohli (75) provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157-run second-wicket stand, before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma. The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan, who in his typically unorthodox fashion, paddled and reverse-paddled his way to an unbeaten 10-ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4.Deflated and dejected, Sunrisers went for broke, wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs. David Warner, who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20, showed why he is one of the most feared white-ball strikers. He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21-ball half-century before falling into the short-ball trap laid by Watson.The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner, Naman Ojha, Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries, meaning they could only muster 182 for 6. Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers, returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling, even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal, the legspiner, chipped away with two wickets.Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump, was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra, their pace spearhead, hobbled off the field after just 2.1 overs. That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs.The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman, making his IPL debut, troubled them with his cutters. Once the job of seeing off his initial burst - a two-over spell - was done, they let loose. Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44-run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break.Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers, but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back. Adam Milne's second spell, in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket, opened the game up. Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door, it was a simple matter of forcing it open, which they did quite easily. In the end, even Ashish Reddy's big hitting was merely a footnote for Sunrisers in what was a forgettable outing.",sports

"Maria Sharapova still faces a hearing after testing positive for meldonium, despite the World Anti-Doping Agency issuing fresh rules for athletes who tested positive for the banned substance before March 1, the International Tennis Federation has said./>Five-times grand slam tennis champion Sharapova tested positive for the drug at this years Australian Open after it was added to WADAs list of banned substances in January.WADA said in a notice on Wednesday that athletes who tested positive for meldonium before March 1 could have bans overturned as the agency was unable to establish how quickly the drug cleared the human body./>But the change in policy will have no bearing on Sharapovas case, the world tennis governing body said.

"Maria Sharapova and scores of other athletes who have tested positive for meldonium could be handed a lifeline after the World Anti-Doping Agency said there was a lack of scientific evidence about how long the drug stays in the system.Amid growing confusion about the status of an avalanche of positive tests for the drug, which was banned on 1 January this year, Wada said its preliminary tests showed that it could take weeks or months for the drug to leave the body. In such cases, athletes could not reasonably have known or suspected that the drug would still be present in their bodies after 1 January, said WADA in a clarification paper to its code signatories on how they should prosecute meldonium cases.In these circumstances Wada considers that there may be grounds for no fault or negligence on the part of the athlete, it added. Sir Craig Reedie, the president of Wada, said: It is designed to explain the science that we know. The issue that it deals with is the time this drug takes to come out of the system. Its an attempt to clarify the many questions that weve been asked.The Russian sports ministry and national Olympic committee welcomed the Wada statement, and the countrys officials suggested there could be a mass amnesty of Russian athletes.The head of the Russian tennis federation (RTF), Shamil Tarpishchev, told the R-Sport agency he hoped Sharapova would be able to play at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, while the head of the Russian swimming federation suggested there could be a swift return to competition for the suspended world champion Yulia Efimova.A Wada spokesman said talk of an amnesty was wide of the mark and that the document was designed to clarify the position.Sharapova confirmed last month that she had tested positive for meldonium during the Australian Open. She was one of 172 athletes, many of them Russian, to test positive for the drug since it was banned in January.",sports

"Lionel Messi's 500th career goal couldn't prevent Barcelona's incredible slump in form from continuing with a fourth defeat in five games 2-1 at home to Valencia on Sunday.Atletico Madrid are now level on 76 points with Barca at the top of La Liga with five games remaining as they beat Granada 3-0, but the Catalans retain the lead thanks to their superior head-to-head record.Third-placed Real Madrid are also only a point behind thanks to their 5-1 win at Getafe on Saturday.Valencia were beaten 7-0 by Barca on their last trip to the Camp Nou just two months ago under former boss Gary Neville, but gained revenge thanks to Ivan Rakitic's own goal and Santi Mina's classy finish before half-time.Messi ended a five-game goal drought to bring up his 500th for club and country, but couldn't inspire a Barca fightback as their alarming collapse in recent weeks continued after a 39-game unbeaten run.Having looked well set for a second consecutive treble just two weeks ago, Barca could now miss out on all three major trophies as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico in midweek and have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games.However, in contrast to recent defeats, Barca boss Luis Enrique praised the performance of his side and believes they are capable of winning their last five games to retain the title.""Luck didn't shine on the team. I congratulate my players for how they faced the adversity during the game,"" said Enrique.""We still depend on ourselves. Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge.""Now we have a marvellous challenge, five games in which if we win them all we are champions""Barca started brightly, but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves.The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him.However, Valencia amazingly went in at half-time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target.The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first-half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner.Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second-half, but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut-back.However, Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark.Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time.Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi, but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point-blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line.Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on, but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat.In contrast to Barca's collapse, Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada.""It will be tough (to win the league), but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win, win and win again,"" said Atletico boss Diego Simeone.Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark.Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time.",sports

"Virat Kohlis 48-ball 79 powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 191 for 5, and AB de Villiers and Shane Watson chipped in with 55 and 33. But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock, who made a bruising 51-ball 108, the first hundred in IPL 2016, to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven-wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.While De Kock starred in the lead role, Karun Nair, who hails from Bangalore, played the supporting role in 134-run third-wicket stand that came off 76 balls.Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets. The groundwork was laid during the course of his second-wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late-overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris, who conceded only 27 off the last four overs.Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off-side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over.De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side, a majority of his runs coming behind square. Once he was set, the other elements to his game surfaced. A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg, and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg. The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket.De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots, but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes. Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal, Harshal Patel and David Wiese, whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs. Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs.De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball. Once into the home stretch, there was a sense of inevitability to the game. After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson, who had him caught behind, Duminy struck the winning runs, Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease.",sports
"South Africa are reluctant to play a day-night test during their tour of Australia as they have no experience with the pink ball, the Proteas players association chief has said.South Africa will tour Australia in a three-test series in the home summer and Cricket Australia announced last year that they wanted one of the fixtures to be a day-night match.Australia hosted New Zealand in the first day-night test in November and while the match drew huge crowds and big television audiences players on both sides complained that the ball was hard to see at times.The pink ball has been developed for day-night test cricket, replacing the traditional red ball which becomes too difficult for batsmen to see after dark.""Our players are not in favour of playing the game under those conditions,"" South African players association Chief Executive Tony Irish told The Australian newspaper.""The main reason is we feel disadvantaged. Not one of our players who will compete in that test has played test match cricket, or any cricket, with a pink ball.""The reluctance to play is a sign of how much importance the South African players place on the series against Australia,"" Irish added.New Zealand players had similar misgivings about last years fixture in Adelaide but were given a A$1 million ($777,000) sweetener by Cricket Australia to commit.Organisers hailed the test a success, despite Australia wrapping up victory in three days.Adelaide tests are traditionally well supported by local fans and interstate visitors but the total attendance of 123,000 was a record in the city for a non-Ashes fixture.Australia, who have also used the pink ball in domestic Sheffield Shield matches, host Pakistan in a three-test series in the coming home summer, with a match at Brisbanes Gabba ground tipped to be played under lights.Cricket Australia will announce their summer schedule on Wednesday and declined to comment on South Africas reservations about the pink ball.",sports

"HYDERABAD: David Warners unbeaten 59-ball 90 steered Sunrisers Hyderabad to their first win of the season after their bowlers had kept Mumbai Indians to 142 in conditions that led to a well-matched contest between bat and ball.Southee kept Mumbai in the game with three well-timed wickets, starting with a late-swinging yorker to Shikhar Dhawan, but Mumbai kept feeding Warner a steady supply of release balls, which he put away merrily.He ended the game with two sixes in three balls, flat-batting Mitchell McClenaghan over mid-off and pulling him over deep square leg, and Sunrisers were home with 15 balls remaining. Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches.It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike, though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage. With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning, Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill, and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper.Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball, playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back-of-the-hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left-arm wristspinner's googly. Then came a self-inflicted wound - Rohit, who came in at No. 4, running himself out while looking for a suicidal single. When Jos Buttler, surprised by extra pace from Sran, gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over, they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere.At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu, who had been promoted to No. 3, and Krunal Pandya, who had been promoted to No. 6 ahead of his brother Hardik, who had batted at No. 3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches. All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think-tank, but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities.Moises Henriques and the left-arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs. But Bipul, who had gone for only 14 off his first three overs, was struck three successive sixes by Krunal in the 14th over. Rayudu stepped out and hit one himself, and Bipul finished with figures of 0 for 40.",sports

"Kolkata Knight Riders thrashed Kings XI Punjab by six wickets here on Sunday to go on top of the table in the Indian Premier League 2016.Knight Riders' bowling depth was perceptible as their spinners ripped through Kings XI, in a sub-par batting performance, to keep them to 138 for 8.In the chase, Robin Uthappa's quickfire fifty effectively sealed the game. In 13 games this season, 12 have been won by the chasing team.Put in to bat, Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm, scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla.The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest, but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order.With two left-handers batting - Marsh and Miller - Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season. The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch.Maxwell soon resorted to a switch-hit off Sunil Narine, but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover. Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5.50.In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings, Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over.In between, Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket, on both sides. He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly-timed lofted drive over long-on. Along with Kyle Abbott, he took Andre Russell's first over - the last of the innings - for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138.Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65-run Powerplay, the most productive in this season.The seamers, Sandeep Sharma and Abbott, were inconsistent but when they found their lengths, Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up, on a pitch offering even bounce and carry.Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal, as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu. Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell, running in from deep midwicket.Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan, but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare.",sports

"Rohit Sharmas 44-ball 62 helped Mumbai Indians to overhaul Royal Challengers Bangalore' 170 for seven with 12 balls to spare here at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.His batting was fluid as he took charge of the chase along with Ambati Raid, who was anything but elegant yet equally effective during his 31.The second-wicket stand of 76 in 55 balls laid the platform for Mumbai's chase, before Iqbal Abdulla gave Royal Challengers a new lease of life by dismissing Rayudu and Rohit in quick succession, both to slogs.Mumbai were 109 for three then, needing 62 off seven overs - well on track as dew took effect. Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard, returning from food poisoning, flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them, and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches.Mumbai, who opted to bowl, were staring at a 200-plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59-run stand, before the unheralded players, in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams, rose to the occasion.Krunal Pandyas twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers. Shane Watson fell not long after, but then Travis Head, on IPL debut, and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7.KL Rahul was put through a short-ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan, during which he was hit hard on the helmet. After the early jitters, though, he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips. Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum.Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball-striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over. Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over.Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase, but Varun Aaron's third over, which went for 19, brought their innings back on track. Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned, a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction. Abdulla's wickets injected a touch of excitement, but any possibility of a close finish was firmly snuffed out by Pollard's charge.",sports
"Batting coach Grant Flower has claimed that Pakistani batsmen are not as hard working as far as fitness is concerned saying our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice.Flower said Pakistani batsmen remain in the elusion that whatever they have been doing in order to keep themselves fit is enough for them to excel in the international circuit.At the international level most of the guys techniques are sound. With Pakistan, it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness, Flower told ESPNCricinfo.You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting.<br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said.Flower said, our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice. They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more. When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself. If you are not answering that question then I dont think you should be there, he said.Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist.He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner.Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country.A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer, he said.He claimed that it is not like 20 minutes in the gym and 20 minutes in the nets.<br/> It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough. A lot of guys kid themselves.They think they are doing enough to be playing for Pakistan and getting great results. I know a lot of time they are not doing enough. Sometimes I wish they could see how worldclass players prepare and what it takes.They watch a lot of cricket but I dont know if they really digest what they see to get to the top, he said. ",sports
"Paul Hawkins, the inventor of the balltracking HawkEye ball tracking system has now come up with a bat sensor to pick up nicks perfectly.<br/> The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks.The on-field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored, a prominent sports website www.sportskeeda.com reported.The tiny sensor which costs 25 (AUD46) can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball.Hawkins, who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert, has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon.Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge.That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket.Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasnt given Hawkins was quoted as saying. More and more batsmen try and get away with it. We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day.Hawkins technology works much like the realtime Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on-field umpires.We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didnt hear is detected, Hawkins said.",sports

"Fakhar Zaman slammed a spectacular century to help Khyber Pakhtunkhwa demolish Punjab by 151 runs in the final of Pakistan Cup 2016 at Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, on Sunday.In the day-night decider, Fakhar (115) and Ahmed Shehzad (62) gave a rapid start to enable KP to pile up 311-9 in the allotted 50 overs.Spinners Yasir Shah (3-26) and Zohaib Khan (3-23) then bowled superbly to dismiss Punjab for 160 in 36.1 overs.KP had also lifted the Pentangular Cup in January 2015 when they defeated Balochistan by six wickets in the final under the captaincy of Junaid Khan in Karachi.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) this season named this event as Pakistan Cup by making some changes.Younis Khan won a vital toss and quite rightly elected to bat first on a pitch that was full of runs.In-form openers Shehzad (62) and Fakhar (115) provided an opening stand of 118 in 15.4 overs.Left-arm spinner Kashif Bhatti finally broke the partnership when he had Shehzad stumped by Mohammad Rizwan. The decision was given through a referral.Shehzad, who seemed in elegant touch, smacked two sixes and seven fours in his fiery 45-ball knock.Shehzad finished the event as the highest scorer with 372 runs, including three fifties and a superb 143.Younis promoted left-handed all-rounder Zohaib Khan (12) in the batting order but he departed early. Shoaib Malik had Zohaib caught at deep square-leg by Amad Butt when he attempted a slog sweep.Zohaib, who struggled against Malik, faced 27 deliveries.Fakhar was held at short mid-on by substitute Asif Ali off Test pacer Ehsan Adil after the Mardan-born player had cracked the fourth century of his career.Fakhar hit Shoaib for a four towards mid-off to complete his hundred. He struck three huge sixes and 12 fours in his 111-ball feat. He ended the event as the second highest scorer with 297 runs, which included one century and two fifties.Fakhar added 52 with Younis (49) for the third wicket.Younis and Fahim Ashraf (31) added 57 for the fourth wicket before Ehsan dismissed the latter to leave KP at 265-4 in 44 overs.Fahim struck three fours and a six from 37 balls. Musadiq Ahmed (19) used long handle, hitting two fours and one six in his rapid ten-ball knock.Younis smacked one six from 59 balls before being caught by Shan Masood off Amad as KP lost four wickets off the last 13 balls.Young all-rounder Amad was the pick of the bowlers with 3-55 in ten overs. Ehsan and Aamer Yamin remained expensive with figures of 2-75 in ten overs and 1-49 in six, respectively.Punjab had a poor start when left-arm pacer Zia-ul-Haq removed Salman Butt (0) and Aamer (1) in quick succession to leave them at 29-2 in 7.2 overs.Asad Shafiq (16) also fell early, held excellently by Fakhar at short-cover off the bowling of Fahim. Asad struck three fours from 15 balls.Left-arm spinner Mohammad Asghar got the prized scalp of Shan Masood (36). Asghar tossed it up, it swung in sharply, Shan went on back-foot to cut it, missed it completely before it crashed the stumps. Shan hit five fours from 40 balls. Punjab were gasping at 55-4 in the 13th over.Shoaib (24) and Rizwan (22) tried to consolidate the innings, but at 97, Test-leggie Yasir Shah had the Punjab captain caught by Fahim in the deep. Malik smashed one six and two fours from 26 deliveries.Left-arm spinner Zohaib dislodged Rizwan and Amad (0) in his first over to leave Punjab tottering at 107-7 in the 23rd over.Fahim took his third catch when he held Rizwan at point after the international stumper had smacked two fours from 33 balls. Yasir removed Saif Badar (10).Zulfiqar Babar (29) and Kashif Bhatti (15) extended KPs wait for celebration as they added 36 for the ninth wicket before Zohaib sent back the former, trapped lbw.Zulfiqar struck two sixes and one four from 32 balls. Yasir completed the rout when he had Ehsan (5) to fold Punjab.Zia-ul-Haq got 2-25 in eight overs.The winners KP received Rs2 million and a glittering trophy, while the runners-up received Rs1 million and runners-up trophy.Besides, Rs100,000 each was handed over to the best all-rounder Zohaib Khan (176 runs, 11 wickets), man of the match Fakhar Zaman, best batsman Ahmed Shehzad (372 runs), best bowlers Mohammad Amir (Sindh) and Zohaib Khan (11 wickets each).KP had brought in Younis Khan and Musadiq Ahmed by dropping Adil Amin and Israrullah.

"South Africa have dropped to No. 6 in the Test rankings, while Pakistan have climbed to third place, in the annual update released by the ICC on Tuesday.Australia have taken a six-point lead over second-placed India, while Pakistan trail India by only one point.England and New Zealand benefited from South Africa's drop, moving to fourth and fifth respectively. West Indies retained their eighth-place ranking but lead Bangladesh by only eight points.South Africa and West Indies lost the most points in the update, 17 and 11 respectively. The calculation process dropped results from 2012-13, while outcomes from 2014-15 were weighted at 50%. Only the latest results had 100% weightage. As a result, South Africa's series victories over England, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan in 2012-13 were not factored in. They lost series to India and England and drew with Bangladesh in the 2015-16 season. West Indies had beaten New Zealand, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in 2012-13 but lost to Australia and Sri Lanka in 2015-16.The update favoured Pakistan, because their 2-0 loss to Sri Lanka in August 2014 was weighted at 50%. In terms of points gained, Bangladesh made the most progress, getting ten points, followed by Australia, who gained six.Zimbabwe, ranked No. 10, have 12 points but were not included in the rankings table released by the ICC on Tuesday because they had not completed the required eight Tests in the new rating period.

""Hatton knows firsthand the dangers of moving up a weight.He suffered his first career defeat when Mayweather knocked him out in a WBC welterweight world title bout in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same fighter again.According to the 37-year-old Hatton, who is now a boxing promoter having hung up his gloves in 2012, Khan must not get involved in a slug fest with the more powerful Alvarez and use his superior movement to stay out of trouble?""Its a fight that I didnt think would be made,"" said Hatton, whose stable includes upcoming British heavyweight Nathan Gorman.""Amir always has good fights, but he needs to make this one boring.""If he tries to have a go with this lad, I dont think he needs me to tell him, he needs to use his speed, move, move.The moment he stops moving those feet, he will be in trouble because Alvarez is a big puncher.""Hattons concern is that by putting on some extra pounds to move up, Khan may have slowed down for what will be his first fight in a year since beating American Chris Algieri.""I dont think its the hand speed. Its the foot speed. Amir is not a fighter like Mayweather, he is more straight backed. ""He has to use his feet to be defensive.",sports
"Former Australian fast bowler and ex Pakistan head coach Geoff Lawson believes Salman Butt can make a comeback for Pakistan saying he is highly motivated and is an outstanding talent.Lawson said Butt is still young and can make a comeback for Pakistan. When I was his coach he was an outstanding talent.That talent doesnt go away but it depends on how much you are motivated and how much you still want to do well.It wouldnt surprise me if Butt made a successful international comeback, Pakpassion.net quoted him as saying.Speaking about Muhammad Amir Lawson said he remembers Amir asa very young player who came to some of my practice sessions when I was coaching Pakistan.Amir was working with the Under 19s and even then looked very impressive.I am pleased that after a difficult period he has comeback bigger and stronger and is bowling terrifically well. It is also very good for Pakistan cricket that he is back he said.Talking about the attitude of some Pakistani players that has come into question after comments from some coaches Lawson said if people are not willing to work hard then there are enough good young players in Pakistan to replace them.Get people in who are motivated. If you arent playing for your country then there is no point in playing cricket.Pakistan has had some pretty successful times lately under Waqar Younis and Misbah ul Haq and one would hope that the players would continue to be motivated, he said.Commenting on the Day Night Test cricket he said he is surprised at the resistance of some countries.Well done to Pakistan in agreeing to play a Day Night Test match in Australia.The pink ball is not that different to a red ball in any case you just have to practice with it and its fine.We use red or white so why not use pink cricket balls Pakistan should be congratulated on agreeing to play in Australia with the pink ball he said.",sports
"Leicester City have the chance of making anything between 150 million pounds and 250 million pounds from their sensational Premier League triumph, according to sports marketing experts.The city of Leicester in England's Midlands should also expect to enjoy a huge commercial boost after its hometown team wrote the unlikeliest of sporting success stories, one that has captured headlines around the world.Yet though the club known as the Foxes will gain this substantial windfall, they still have a long way to go to join the true big-money elite of world football.The club that had never won the top-flight crown in its history will cash in through the 90 million pounds in prize money from the Premier League, and money from competing in Europe's Champions League next season, as well as increased TV and match day revenue.With Leicester's increasing attraction to sponsors as the champions of the Premier League, which possesses remarkable global appeal, it could all be worth as much as 150 million pounds to the club, said the sports and entertainment intelligence firm, Repucom, on Tuesday.Other experts have put the estimates much higher with some British media reports suggesting that the figure could be much nearer 250 million pounds, particularly if Leicester's success proves to be more than a one-season wonder.Leicester's TV audiences have soared by over 23% globally this season and because of the excitement inspired by their run to the title, audiences in the UK have grown from 785,000 to over one million per game.In Italy, the numbers watching Leicester's games have doubled, largely thanks to the interest generated by the club being managed by Italian coach Claudio Ranieri.""Leicester's media values have jumped by 30 percent globally whilst in the U.S. they have grown by over 70 percent, showing first-hand the increase in value to current and potential sponsors,"" Repucom said.Leicester's first appearance in the lucrative Champions League will also make a vast difference to their coffers in the region of 36 million pounds.As well as increased TV exposure, it will generate increased revenues from group stage fees, a proportion of the competition's market pool and a participation bonus, totalling 33 million pounds, as well as 3 million pounds performance bonus.A story which had echoes of Leicester's triumph was Atletico Madrid's breaking of the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly to win La Liga in 2014.Based on the increased match day and commercial revenues that unlikely champions Atletico gleaned, Leicester can expect to see between 10 to 15 million pounds boost in that area.""Leicester City FC's real commercial potential will become clearer in the season break as brands vie to associate themselves to the club,"" Spencer Nolan, head of consulting at Repucom, said.So, much will depend, in the mid to long-term on how successful the club, owned by Thailand billionaire Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, are in developing their fan base.Though their victory was greeted enthusiastically in Thailand, where Srivaddhanaprabha's family runs the duty-free empire King Power, their fan base is still not in the same league as the historic elite of the English game like Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool.Meanwhile, Leicester itself hopes for an economic boon, with the local newspaper, Leicester Mercury, reporting that financial experts believe the overall economy in the city could benefit to the tune of 49 million pounds.The numbers of visitors to the city have grown rapidly since the discovery of the remains of King Richard III in 2012 and now tourism chiefs hope that being the home of England's football champions will prove a draw card for Leicester too.",sports

"India, a country notoriously slow to adopt new ideas, has now embraced the concept of day-night test matches and it will surely not be long before twilight five-day games are a regular feature on the sub-continent.India and Pakistan are set to play floodlit tests this year while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are considering following suit pending the results of domestic trials.Indias all powerful board of control, the BCCI, has traditionally been suspicious of anything new and ensured the worlds second most populous nation was the last of the major cricketing powers to embrace the Twenty20 format of the game.That embrace has quickly turned into a passionate love affair courtesy of the Indian Premier League (IPL) but the BCCI is still resisting the Decision Review System (DRS) with all its considerable might.It insists it will not accept the technology, which is aimed at reducing umpiring howlers, until it is foolproof.As a result DRS are not used in any bilateral series involving India.The commercial prospects of day-night tests, however, have not been lost on the worlds richest cricket board and it announced last month it would host a floodlit test against New Zealand when the Black Caps tour later this year.BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said the controversial pink ball used in such contests would be trialled in the domestic Duleep Trophy to help captain Virat Kohli and his team prepare for the day-nighter.""There are lots of factors that need to be taken into account.Things like dew factor, how the spinners bowl with the pink Kookaburra (ball) on Indian pitches,"" Thakur said.The dates and venues of the series against New Zealand have yet to be confirmed but Kolkatas Eden Gardens has been put forward as a possible venue by Cricket Association of Bengal president and former India captain Sourav Ganguly.""We want to play host to a pink-ball test in the future,"" said Ganguly.""We will try to host a local four-day match with the pink ball under the floodlights as a test.""Turnout for test matches in India generally lags far behind the full houses that can be expected for one-day internationals and some IPL fixtures.Even those in the BCCI suspicious of change, therefore, were enthused by what they saw at Adelaide Oval last November when Australia and New Zealand played out the first floodlit test.PICTURESQUE GROUNDThe match only lasted only three days, hence the controversy over the pink ball, but attracted more than 123,000 fans through the gates at the picturesque ground as the hosts clinched the trans-Tasman series.The Adelaide turnout looked even more impressive at a time when the games longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds amid the many burgeoning Twenty20 leagues springing up across the cricketing globe.Even Sri Lanka, who turned down Pakistans proposal to play a day-night test in 2013 citing their inexperience with the pink ball, are now considering the option.""We are looking at it very positively,"" Sri Lanka Cricket secretary Mohan de Silva told Reuters.""We are gearing ourselves for the eventuality.The ICC (International Cricket Council) has cleared it and (at some point), wed also fall in line.""The ICC approved day-night tests in 2012 after successful trials of pink balls in Australia, England, Pakistan and South Africa.Pakistan will play a day-night test in Australia in December and might play one before that, against West Indies in October, provided the Caribbean nations agree to the proposal.Another Asian team, Bangladesh, are being a little more cautious about dipping their toes into the water.New Zealand have proposed hosting a day-nighters when Bangladesh visit the country in December and England want to play a twilight test during their tour of the South Asian country in October-November, a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official told Reuters.""We have not decided on either of the proposals yet,"" BCB media and communication committee chairman Mohammed Jalal Yunus said.""We trialled the pink ball here but there were some issues regarding the shine and durability.We need to address those issues before taking a decision.",sports
Bangladesh lifted a ban on disgraced fast bowler Shahadat Hossain Tuesday allowing him to play domestic matches weeks after he apologised for torturing an 11 year old girl he employed as a maid.Hossain was banned from all forms of cricket last year by the Bangladesh Cricket Board after he became a subject of investigation for alleged criminal offence which drew huge media interest.The BCB said Hossain was now free to play domestic cricket including the lucrative Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) after he made an emotional appeal seeking a return to cricket.He however will not be considered for national team selection until his legal issues are settled BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury said adding the ban was lifted on humanitarian considerations.Hossain who has denied abusing the girl in the past apologised on April 28 for what he called his misdeed and said he had made a mistake.I regret the unwarranted incident I was involved in and apologise to the whole nation the cricketer said in an emotional statement.Bangladeshi police charged the 29 year old pacer and his wife Nritto Shahadat with charges of assault and torture last year after the young girl was found crying on a roadside her eyes bruised and swollen.The couple went into hiding after police raided their house in September when the girl complained that they had beaten and tortured her.Television footage showed her frail and thin looking appearance and police said one of her hands had been burnt with a hot cooking paddle.Hossain spent two months in custody after he handed himself in to police on October 5 and has since been released on bail as was his wife.A judge has ordered that the couple would face trial and if convicted they would face up to 14 years in jail.But a source said the couple and the girl s family may agree to a financial settlement that would see her withdrawing the allegations.,sports

"Australias cricket board will make it compulsory for players to wear helmets when facing fast and medium-paced bowling in line with recommendations from a review into the death of Test batsman Phillip Hughes.Wicketkeepers and players fielding close to the wicket will also have to wear helmets in first class matches in accordance with the David Curtain review, which was released on Wednesday.The helmets, mandatory in games and during practice, must adhere to the highest British standard, Cricket Australia (CA) said.Hughes was struck on the back of the head by a rising delivery when batting for South Australia in a domestic match in November 2014.He died two days later in a Sydney hospital aged 25.""Theres not a day that goes by where we dont think of Phillip,"" CA boss James Sutherland told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday.""This report wont bring him back and it wont do anything to ease the pain of his family or his loved ones who miss him most.""But we have a responsibility and a duty to ensure nothing like this ever happens again.""Hughess death shocked the cricketing world and ignited a debate about safety standards, particularly for batsmen, who face fast bowling that can exceed 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph).Hughes was wearing an Australian standard helmet when he was struck but the Curtain report said even the newer British standard helmet available at the time would not have afforded him extra protection from the blow.The report also said an apparent delay in the arrival of the ambulance team that treated Hughes played no part in his death.""I am of the opinion the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury,"" it said.The report also recommended wicketkeepers play with protective eye-wear but stopped short of endorsing the clip-on neck guards on the back of helmets, which some players have worn after Hughess death.Sutherland said CA still encouraged players to wear the guards but conceded, like the report, that more research was required to determine whether they actually increased safety.""Were certainly taking up the running on that to make sure we understand it better,"" he said.Sutherland said the board had also sought approval from the International Cricket Council to trial the use of injury substitutes who could bat and bowl in domestic games.Substitutes have been permitted to replace injured or ill players in matches for over 100 years but are not allowed to bat, bowl or act as wicketkeepers or captains, according to the laws of the game.Initially the substitutes would replace players ruled out by concussion but in future their use could be expanded to include other forms of injury, Sutherland added.",sports

"MEXICO CITY: FIFA unveiled the timetable of its delayed bidding process for the 2026 World Cup on Tuesday, with president Gianni Infantino's plans for a 40-team tournament to be decided upon by October and a final decision on the hosts to be made in May 2020.Football's world governing body said it would consider giving the green light to joint bids and review a rule which currently allows a continent to stage the tournament every eight years.A FIFA source said they had considered increasing this wait period to 12 years or more and that there had been no discussions about allowing a continent to host successive World Cups.This could mean that with Russia hosting the 2018 World Cup, Europe would have to wait until at least 2030 before staging the tournament again.The decisions were among the first passed by the new-look FIFA Council, which was holding its maiden meeting since it replaced the old executive committee under reforms passed in February.The Council, which has a strategic role, ruled that bidding nations would have to meet requirements on human rights, sustainable event management and environmental protection. Bidders who did not meet ""technical requirements"" would be excluded, it said.Infantino was elected as FIFA president in February when one of his main promises was to increase the number of teams in the finals from 32 to 40, a proposal which is strongly opposed by Europe's biggest clubs.FIFA said that decisions were expected by October on the number of teams, the format for the tournament, the ""eligibility of (continental) confederations to bid"" and whether to allow joint bids.Joint bids were banned in 2011 but Infantino has said he wants to encourage them, possibly spreading the tournament around several countries in a region.CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONFIFA said that a ""consultation process"", outlining new standards for bidders, would run until May 2017, followed by a preparation phase running until December 2018 when countries would have to submit their bids.The bids would be evaluated from January 2019 to February 2020 with a final decision three months later.FIFA was forced to reform its bidding process after the vote in December 2010 awarded the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.That vote is the subject of a criminal investigation by Swiss authorities, while Qatar's preparations have also been marred by allegations of abuse of migrant workers in the construction industry. Qatar says it is working to solve the issue.Under revised statutes, the hosts will be chosen by the 209 members of FIFA at its annual Congress. The Council, however, will still draw up a shortlist of three candidates. Previously, hosting rights were decided by the old executive committee.FIFA said that Gibraltar and Kosovo's applications for membership would be submitted to the Congress on Friday and that both would be allowed to take part in the 2018 World Cup qualifying competition if accepted.Benin was suspended with immediate effect due to legal interference in the country's football federation. A decision not to suspend Greece was ratified by the Council.FIFA Council member Fernando Sarney praised Infantino's leadership on Tuesday.""Things are getting calmer in FIFA,"" the Brazilian representative told reporters.""Gianni is talking about football, he is travelling around, talking to people and trying to put football back into our conversations because before we talked about everything apart from football.""",sports

"Pakistan's newly appointed coach Mickey Arthur feels that dearth of international cricket at home has damaged Pakistan cricket and termed it as one of the reasons behind Pakistans decline in the game.The former Australia and South Africa coach said that Pakistani batsmen will have to play an important role to achieve results for the team.Pakistan is playing all the cricket outside the country. Every time they play it is an away series which is really hard. It is always difficult playing outside your condition and it has dented Pakistan cricket, in an exclusive interview with a private news channel Arthur said.The South African-born coach said that he picked up the role of coaching Pakistan team considering it as a big challenge and that he was looking forward to deliver results but demanded consistency in team decisions for any positive outcome.I think its a great challenge. Pakistan cricket has struggled a little bit in the last couple of years and certainly I am keen to bring it back to its rightful place in the ranking and the rightful place in world cricket, he said.Talking about his first assignment with Pakistan team, the tour of England, Arthur said that the series will be a big challenge for the players and key will be to learn how to perform outside the United Arab Emirates, where Pakistan has been playing most of its cricket recently.Pakistan has got a wonderful group of bowlers. We need to work on batting, particularly outside the UAE, and that will be key. Also we need to bring the fielding up to standards of international level, he added.It will be a challenge for players that how they are going to handle the conditions outside the UAE and Pakistan. You need your batsmen to step up and score runs.<br/> So technically we need to work really hard to get our batting 100 percent right, said 47-year-old former cricketer.During Arthurs coaching stint, South Africa reached the top in all the three formats.Arthur said he is confident that Pakistan can also achieve the top position but warned that it can be achieved only if there is consistency in team decisions.<br/> You need opportunity and time to build the team in order to achieve the result.<br/> We need to be consistent with our selections, we need to be consistent with our players and we need to allow players to express themselves without any consequences.Thats the key, players need to find out how they go about and play in certain situations. I hope we can give the players that experience and make sure they go forward, he said.Arthur said he did not feel any language barrier while working with Pakistani players during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year, where he coached the team Karachi Kings but added that he would still look to have a local coach as his assistant so that his message is not lost in translation.I will have a local coach as my assistant who can deliver my message to the guys.<br/> That is quite important.

"MEXICO CITY: A few steps from the entrance to Mexico City's imposing Presidente Hotel, where FIFA delegates are staying during this week's Congrees, a boy of around 10-years-old sells tamarind balls covered in chili powder from a cart for 10 Mexican pesos ($0.55) each.The spicy, tangy sweets are a local specialty yet are unlikely to have been tasted by the FIFA delegates. The guests of world soccer are more likely to be inside sipping lattes for eight times the price.FIFA has often been known for lavishing a five-star lifestyle on its delegates and officials. When former president Sepp Blatter went to an event in Zurich with the city's mayor, he arrived in a chauffeur-driven limousine while the politician came and went by tram.But after Gianni Infantino was elected president of soccer's scandal-plagued body in February, one of his first pledges was to make FIFA more humble, suggesting, among other things, that federation officials no longer wore suits to matches.The early signs were promising as he flew to Britain for his first official engagement by a budget airline rather than the private plane favoured by his predecessor.But this week's Congress in Mexico City has looked as extravagant as any held under Blatter.FIFA confirmed that it paid all the expenses for each of its 209 member associations to bring a three-man delegation, flying business class and staying in five-star accommodation. Each delegate was also given $1,000 in spending money.LEAVE THE BUBBLERooms at the Presidente are booked for about $400 a night. Members of the FIFA Council, the world governing body's board, are staying at the plusher Four Seasons hotel where rooms typically cost $675 a night, according to hotel booking websites.FIFA sources told Reuters that efforts were being made to persuade delegates to leave their bubble but having them walk a few hundred yards took some effort.Some were seen walking the 500 metres from their hotel to Thursday's opening ceremony at the city's 10,000-seat National Auditorium, considered one of the world's best entertainment venues.It was seen by FIFA as a step, albeit it a small one, in the right direction, although others insisted on taking a luxury bus.The night before, FIFA seemed as detached as ever when their so-called Legends team of former international footballers took part in an exhibition match at Mexico City's historic Azteca stadium.FIFA billed it as a ""football fiesta"" and said it was ""engaging more with the football world and getting football back to the heart of FIFA, It was closed to the public.It was witnessed only by specially invited guests who spent most of the evening in a tent built onto the pitch, where they were pampered with wine, champagne and canapes, while traditional Mexican dances were performed on a stage.Privately, FIFA sources said the event had been hastily arranged and had not been what they intended.Infantino, who has vowed to cut costs, was somewhat vague when asked about it at a media conference on Friday, though he said it was something FIFA could look into.""I think it's always been the case that they are paid $1,000 as a fee for the delegates, it's part of the budget approved by the finance committee,"" he said.""It's good that it's been raised and we might have a look at it.""",sports
"MEXICO CITY: Indonesia's suspension from international soccer for government interference in the country's football federation has ended after almost a year, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Friday.However, the FIFA Congress confirmed the existing suspensions for Kuwait and Benin over government interference in their football associations.Infantino told delegates the decision on Indonesia, one of Asia's biggest soccer markets, was taken by the FIFA Council after the government agreed to lift a decree considered to constitute unacceptable interference in the football federation.""The government of Indonesia has advised us that the decree that was causing the suspension had been lifted,"" said Infantino.The Asian Football Confederation welcomed Indonesia back into the ""Asian football family"" but said it would continue to fight any government interference in the running of the game.""... the AFC Executive Committee reiterated this week their continued stand against government intervention in sport generally and football in particular,"" the regional governing body said in a statement on Saturday.""As at their meetings in Delhi last November, Doha in January and Kuala Lumpur in March, the AFC Executive Committee in Mexico City made it clear that there was no place or justification for government interference.""FIFA stepped in to ban the country in June after a long-running row between the government and the local football association (PSSI) over which teams should be entered into the top-flight domestic league.The government suspended the PSSI after they ignored requests to ban two teams whose owners failed to meet their new governance regulations.FIFA, after repeated warnings to resolve the row, then banned the country, ruling them out of the joint 2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup qualifying campaign.Infantino added that the cases involving Kuwait and Benin would be resolved swiftly.""I'm very sad to be here and have to propose to you that we suspend two associations,"" said Infantino. ""On the other hand, we need to protect our associations from government interference, it is one of our major tasks.""The Kuwait FA (KFA) was suspended by FIFA in October after soccer's governing body said a draft sports law constituted interference in the nation's football association.",sports

"The ICC has opened discussions with broadcasters about organising World Twenty20 tournaments in 2018 and 2022, thus the event will be played every two years.This means two extra World Cups will be added to the existing schedule as it looks to cash in on the booming popularity of the games shortest format.After the success of the World Twenty20 in India recently, the ICC does not want to wait another four years for the next tournament, which is due to be staged in Australia in 2020.This was proposed at the ICC recent board meeting in Dubai about holding a World Twenty20 every two years with West Indies a possibility for the proposed 2018 tournament and the UAE in 2022. The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICCs annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion.An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2?billion (1.4?billion) rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023. That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments (the World Cup, Champions Trophy and World Twenty20) on a four year cycle.But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League, which featured domestic teams from around the world, has left a hole in the calendar in September-October, a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations.Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the mens World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018, possibly as a run in or at the same as the womens version is due to take place in the Caribbean. But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market, where the vast broadcast deals are on offer.Another possibility is South Africa, although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas. The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India. England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup.The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings. The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83?million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2.45?million viewers, the channels highest rating for a cricket match.Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5.75?billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46?million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook.

"A diligent half-century from Alex Hales, coupled with some home-ground know-how from Jonny Bairstow, helped England to regroup with a 88-run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka, after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break.By tea, Hales was unbeaten on 71, his second Test half-century in nine innings and his highest yet, beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January.At the other end was Bairstow, who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5, but responded with the sort of sparky counter-punching. Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka, who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5, thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs.After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no-brainer for both captains, England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months - a situation that might have been tailor-made for Alastair Cook. He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10,000 Test runs, and after getting off the mark with a sixth-ball clip for four through midwicket, appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction, in the 18th over of the day, tore up the pre-conceived script.Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over. Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries, but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep, he was drawn into another from the slower, wobblier Shanaka. The full length outside off left him a touch, and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper. He was gone for 16, and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December.Three balls later, however, such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds. Nick Compton - whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team-mates' struggles to impose themselves - poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip. He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history, and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003, to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run.And, as if that was not enough of an impact on debut, Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Joe Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip.It was a dream start for Shanaka, who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play, and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.By tea, however, Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand, as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play.",sports
"Alastair Cooks bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10,000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley, as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much-heralded top order.By lunch, Cook had been dismissed for 16 - still 20 runs shy of his landmark - with Nick Compton and Joe Root, the local hero and newly-crowned England Test player of the year, both following for ducks in a sensational ten-minute spell before lunch.It was left to Alex Hales, who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour, and England's own debutant, James Vince, to glue the innings together. Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence, as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline - and a definite bout of indigestion - of 57 for 3.Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new-ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep.Instead, having launched his Test career with a maiden, Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off, and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal, the keeper.Then, three balls later, Compton poked with caution at a perfect off-stump line and length, to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip.Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally, as Root - in such golden touch in all formats - was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium-pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead.It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too, who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad, their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago, will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury.The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler, Dushmantha Chameera, as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner, Rangana Herath, whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break.Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka.",sports

"A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa, the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport.The deal, reportedly worth 60 million pounds ($88 million), will see the chairman of little-known Recon Group, Xia Jiantong, become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team.Under the leadership of Xi, an avid fan, China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup, and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies, television rights, transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad.More broadly, Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan ($782 billion) by 2025, about five times its current scale.China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year, when a consortium led by state-backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival, Manchester City.The Villa deal, however, with 100 percent ownership, is not just an investment.""The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club,"" said Mark Dreyer, Beijing-based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider.Crosstown arch-rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia, following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung.Villa's American owner Randy Lerner, who put the club on the market in 2014, struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league.Recon Group, Xia's privately owned holding company, owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges.The deal with American-educated Xia, 39, ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner, who bought the midlands club for 62.2 million pounds in 2006. Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa, who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top-flight title seven times.The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table, with only half the number of points of the next worst team.""Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour,"" said Fredrik van Huynh, Shanghai-based director of HHC Sports Group. ""It will have pushed down the price quite significantly.""Xia, who studied at Harvard University and has a doctorate, took to his official microblog late on Wednesday to wish the club's fans ""health and happiness"".Earlier this month he posted: ""Go, Villa, Go! We will be back.""The club said Xia's immediate objective was ""to return Aston Villa to the Premier League and then to have the club finish in the top six, bringing European football back to Villa Park"".It added the deal would also help make Villa the most famous football club in China.Dreyer at China Sports Insider dismissed that as ""simply ludicrous"", given the appeal of much bigger rivals such as Spain's Barcelona and England's Manchester United and Arsenal.""I think fans of the club will remain sceptical until it becomes clear what his true motivations are,"" he added.($1 = 0.6837 pounds)",sports
"Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday, flooring Liverpool with a 3-1 victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe's second-tier competition.Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel's St Jakob-Park having been the architect of their heroics, scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge's opener.It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp's side should have been home and dry, but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling.Unai Emery's team hit back with three goals in 25 minutes, the first coming just 17 seconds after the interval, to claim the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons and become the first side in 40 years to win three consecutive European competitions.""At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it,"" Emery said. ""It is our competition and we underlined that once again.""For Liverpool and Klopp, who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February's League Cup disappointment, it was a dispiriting occasion.His team's hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed, leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition.""The players are still young,"" Klopp told reporters. ""We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC.""It had looked, however, like being an entirely different outcome at the interval.The opening goal arrived after 35 minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge, who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin-point curling finish off the outside of his left boot.The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents.The halftime whistle came to Sevilla's rescue, however, allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch.Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno, whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season, darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira, who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side-foot into an empty net.Then it was Liverpool's turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after 63 minutes.Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner.The final nail in Liverpool's coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet, only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again.After some pushing and shoving the goal stood, leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb.Having retreated so far into their shell, however, they were incapable of rising above base camp.",sports
"The England pace attack ripped out Sri Lanka for 91 after Jonny Bairstow made an excellent century to put the hosts in complete control of the first Test on the second day in Leeds on Friday.Bairstows superb knock of 140 lifted England to 298 in their first innings before James Anderson and Stuart Broad took nine wickets between them in favourable conditions for seam bowling at Headingley.England captain Alastair Cook enforced the follow-on and the touring side negotiated two deliveries to reach one for no wicket before bad light ended play. Sri Lanka trail by 206 runs in the opening match of the three-Test series.England had resumed in the morning on 171 for five and Bairstow and Alex Hales extended their sixth-wicket partnership to 141. Hales, on 86, was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover.Moeen Ali (nought) and Broad (two) were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow, dropped on 70, completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground.Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn, the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid-on off Chameera.Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly.Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow, leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three.Dinesh Chandimal, on 15, was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow.Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one, Chameera (2) drove Broad to Finn at mid-off and Lahiru Thirimanne, on 22, was caught by Finn at mid-on off Broad.Anderson completed his 19th five-wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg-side.",sports
"England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played a brilliant counter-punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps. With a total of 298 to defend, Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea.It was a situation far removed from the 83-for-5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day. And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear, it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal, Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing, to reach the break without further damage.Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon, Sri Lanka's openers, Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over, when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch.Instead, they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as, first, Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left-handed Karunaratne, who departed for a 12-ball duck, before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11.One over later, and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full-length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence, for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps.Chandimal and Mathews, however, stood firm in a 31-run stand before the interval.The story of the day, however, remained Bairstow's happy homecoming - a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home. Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not-out batsman, Alex Hales, had established on the first afternoon, England's sixth-wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali. England's No. 8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country, but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion. He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth, from Chameera, and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad, to Mendis under the helmet at short leg.It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera, bowling only his second over of the day. He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work, but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat-footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread-eagled his own stumps via an inside edge.Bairstow simply stared down the track, rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst. But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session. From the first ball of Chameera's next over, Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers, paused as a wild shy came in at the non-striker's end, then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil.",sports
"Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century, and his first on his home ground at Headingley, as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka. However, with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures, Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session, and will be armed with a brand-new ball when play resumes after lunch.Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon, the pair extended their sixth-wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top-order wobble, when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs. Bairstow was once again the aggressor, as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground - his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198.Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption, capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers, Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep, offered opportunities to fillet the third-man boundary. He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however, on 70, when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right, as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track.At the other end, Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century. It was a grind, as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline, except for one clear opportunity on 82, when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews.It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed. But four runs later, and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack, Hales' patience snapped for good. In Herath's second over, he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers. A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover, who pouched the offering with a well-judged dive.Hales was visibly distraught, lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two. Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field, he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener.It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity. Instead, having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries, with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well, he will know that the jury remains out. At least, for those of a superstitious bent, he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley - both Sam Robson (2014) and Adam Lyth (2015) were out of the side by the end of the summer.If Hales' failing had been to linger too long, then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali.

"England and Wales Cricket Board (EWCB) director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer.The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday.As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests oneday internationals and oneoff Twenty20internationals against both tourists.But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win, two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the whiteball matches www.skysports.com reported.An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty20 matches in the case of this summers tours and an unsponsored prize of 25,000 will be put up by the home board. The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday.Today Im introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats, said the former England captain.The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops. Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play. We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself.Two separate whiteball teams and a redball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests. What this doesnt do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one-day series and the Twenty20 match as well. But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for.The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds.If the same points formula had been applied to Englands winter tours, the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line. Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect, said Strauss.If you look at the last two series we played  against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20. Anyone out there who doesnt see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand.I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and weve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12-18 months but there are some worrying signs there, so lets act before its too late.",sports

"Manchester United substitute Jesse Lingard's superb volley in extra time secured a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday for their first major trophy in three years.However, their Dutch manager Louis van Gaal was left wondering whether it would be enough to preserve his job two seasons into a three-year contract amid British media reports that Jose Mourinho would be offered the job next week.The game was locked at 1-1 after 90 minutes, Jason Puncheon coming off the bench to put London side Palace ahead 12 minutes from time before Juan Mata equalised three minutes later.United central defender Chris Smalling was sent off in the extra period for a second yellow card but Lingard's moment of class gave them the Cup for the first time since 2004.""It's fantastic to win this title for the club, the fans and also for me,"" Van Gaal said. ""Now I have won a Cup in four countries. Not many managers can say that so I am very happy.""I don't want to talk about leaving the club.""BRILLIANT RUNUnderdogs Palace took the lead when Puncheon, who had only come on six minutes earlier, deftly controlled a long ball into the area and fired past United goalkeeper David de Gea.But within three minutes Wayne Rooney went on a brilliant run across the edge of the Palace area and crossed for Marouane Fellaini to set up the equaliser for Spaniard Mata.Despite playing the second period of extra time with 10 men after Smalling's dismissal, United poured forward and Lingard's goal secured a 12th FA Cup triumph, equalling Arsenal's record.""I saw it come across and it landed nicely for me, all I had to do was hit it sweet and luckily I did that. As a sub you always have to be ready. Thankfully I was,"" Lingard said.Van Gaal, who arrived for his news conference carrying the trophy, added: ""It was a super goal when we needed it.""It was unbelievable that we had injuries again but in spite of going down to 10 players we showed the spirit we have shown on the road to the final.""Palace manager Alan Pardew, who played when the London club lost the replayed 1990 final against United, was frustrated by two refereeing decisions from Mark Clattenburg, who will be in charge of next weekend's Champions League final.He felt Wilfried Zaha should have had a penalty when tackled by Rooney and that play should have been waved on as Connor Wickham recovered from Smalling's challenge and scored.""It was a great cup final and could have gone either way,"" Pardew told reporters.UNITED DANGEROUSPalace did not get quite enough from speedy winger Zaha, who United once bought for 15 million pounds ($21.76 million) before selling him back to their opponents, and Yannick Bolasie.The London side threatened mainly from set pieces, although the tall Fellaini was a valuable asset in defending them.United made the more dangerous chances throughout the game, hitting the post twice early in the second half through Fellaini and young French striker Anthony Martial.Rooney was an influential captain in his deeper midfield role and 18 year-old Marcus Rashford made several of their best opportunities, but had to go off injured in the 72nd minute.Van Gaal could not say how serious the injury was or whether it would prevent Rashford joining the England squad next week.It was the second time United had won the FA Cup after having a player sent off. Irish defender Kevin Moran was the first man dismissed in a final, when they beat Everton in 1985. Smalling was the fourth and the first Englishman.There was a bonus in Palace's defeat for West Ham United, who will join United in the Europa League next season after the east London side move into their new Olympic Stadium ground.",sports

He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage.""Van Gaal, though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club, was not so happy to be moving on.""I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three-year plan,"" he said.""It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC, and in doing so, I have fulfilled a long-held ambition.""I have been privileged during my management career to have won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup, which is steeped in so much history, will always be one of the most special achievements of my career.""That success, however, could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings, missing out on Champions League qualification, and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories.DISGRUNTLED FANSAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago, Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season.However, United's inability to produce the free-flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson's trophy-laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands.For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football, Van Gaal's stultifying approach was hard to swallow, particularly when it did not work well, after he spent almost 300 million pounds ($434.34 million) on players.This season's dire statistics, beyond the key one of fifth place, are a damning indictment of the Dutchman's tactics.United scored 49 goals in 38 games, in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over 76 and fourth-placed Manchester City's 71.They had the joint-highest number of goalless draws in the division, while Opta noted that United's 430 shots on target was 15th in the 20-team league and they made more backward passes than any other side.It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either.A story in Monday's Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman's rigid tactical directions, which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first-time shots.It also reported that the two most senior players, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post-match ""evaluation sessions"" in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team matesWIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTIONWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the 64-year-old former Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May 2014 following Moyes's sacking.He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth-place finish but, despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay, Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger, United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September.French striker Martial apart, the new players struggled to justify their fees, and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford, who has rapidly emerged from United's youth team to earn a place in the England squad.By mid-December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven.At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters, already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League, chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal's side were in a 2-1 loss to FC Midjytlland.Despite recovering with a 5-1 win in the second leg, United then lost to Liverpool in the round of 16.A late challenge for fourth place, the Cup run and the fan-pleasing introduction of the youngsters, bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood.Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho, once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms.The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of success across Europe, combined with a larger-than-life personality, mean that, if he is appointed, United fans will at least be able to look forward to next season rather than dreading it.",sports

"English football's biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport's most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho, according to Sky TV reports, agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday.After a trophy-laden career with Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday, with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson.The 53-year-old, sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells, had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford.The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in 12 years when they beat Crystal Palace 2-1 after extra-time in Saturday's Wembley final.Van Gaal's preferred possession-dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast, direct attacking, was widely criticised, and it appeared to take his players time to adapt.Mourinho is also known for pragmatism, however, relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard-working midfielders and strikers.He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game.Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top-flight title in 50 years in his first campaign, retaining it the following season.He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup.Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea, he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor -- and troubled -- start to the 2015-16 season led to his sacking.DIVIDED OPINIONHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford, touted in the media for months, will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes, he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be.The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style.Van Gaal's FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club's fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety-first football being served up.Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal.There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore, something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs.However, after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years, the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the 'Special One' gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport's top table.Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese ""could save"" the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce, who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence, said the chance to bring in Mourinho was ""too good to miss"".Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti, who will coach Bayern Munich next season, said Mourinho would be a ""fantastic signing"", adding United had ""lost its identity this last year"".Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona, however, said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead, saying he ""loved"" Mourinho but that his style of play is ""not Manchester United"".Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is ""similar"" to Van Gaal in being a ""workaholic"" who ""prepares perfectly on how to win"".De Boer, who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona, said of Mourinho: ""Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins.

"Brazilian investigators have expanded their probe into possible corruption around the staging of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro this August to include all the venues and services financed with federal funds, a lead prosecutor told Reuters.Federal investigations have previously focused on ""legacy"" modernization projects not directly tied to the Games but this newly disclosed probe includes Olympic Park and the Deodoro area where Olympic venues are located, federal prosecutor Leandro Mitidieri said.""It's not just the physical works we're looking at - it is contracts for services, security, everything that used federal funds,"" he told Reuters from his Rio de Janeiro office late on Tuesday.The Olympics were meant to showcase Brazil's rise as a global power. Instead, they will take place as suspended President Dilma Rousseff faces an impeachment trial, the economy suffers its worst recession since the 1930s, an outbreak of the Zika virus prompts health concerns and a massive corruption scandal infuriates Brazilians.Mitidieri said his team is also investigating what happened to federal funds earmarked for cleaning Guanabara Bay, where Olympic sailing events will take place, and lakes that surround the main Olympic venues in western Rio's Barra neighborhood.Those bodies of water have heavy sewage contamination and remain badly polluted despite promises to drastically improve them as a legacy achievement of the Olympics.Another team of federal prosecutors, along with federal police, is investigating whether the Rio de Janeiro state water utility company Cedae committed environmental crimes by not properly treating sewage in Rio's metropolitan area of 12 million people, Mitidieri said.Rio utility Cedae said it had not been notified about the investigation and could not make a comment without understanding more about the probe.Mitidieri would not say if his team had uncovered any proof of corruption - but he added that detailed announcements about the investigation's results would be made in coming weeks.Five construction firms are building most of the 39 billion reais ($10.8 billion) worth of venues and infrastructure needed for Rio's Olympics. The figure includes at least 1.76 billion reais in federal funds, according to documents from Brazil's federal accounting court.All five companies are caught up in an investigation into price fixing and kickbacks at state-run oil company Petrobras, a two-year probe that has seen scores of top executives and politicians jailed, charged or under investigation.The Petrobras (PETR4.SA) investigation is what led federal police and prosecutors to begin looking at possible corruption tied to the Olympics.Federal authorities have already said they are investigating the Porto Maravilha project, an 8 billion real facelift of Rio's dilapidated port area, and also the expansion of the city's metro line to the Olympic area in Barra.Court files made public in March showed police uncovered documents from executives of Latin America's largest construction firm, Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL], that referenced 1 million reais in suspected bribes connected to those two big legacy projects.Odebrecht is at the center of the Petrobras scandal and is involved in over half of all Olympic projects by value, according to contracts reviewed by Reuters.A spokeswoman for Odebrecht said by email that the company had no comment to make.Mitidieri declined to provide details on which companies are the focus of the federal probe, though he did note that OAS SA [OAS.UL] and Queiroz Galvao had ""a lot of activity"" in the Deodoro region of the Olympics. OAS did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Queiroz Galvao wrote in an email that the company had not been notified about the investigation and had no further comment.Rio de Janeiro's city government oversees most Olympic construction projects, though a few are financed by the federal or state government. The city government says contracts were mostly funded with private resources and that all bids were overseen by regulators.Rio 2016, the local organizing committee, handles some non-permanent structures like seating, and has a budget of 7 billion reais.The federal government, Mitidieri noted, is by law responsible for any debts the local organizing committee may incur.The Rio 2016 local organizing committee referred questions to the mayor's office.The mayor's office said it would not comment without knowing what exact contracts were under investigation. It added in its emailed response that all contracts were carried out in a transparent manner and that city officials were prepared to provide any clarifications necessary.",sports

Real, on the other hand, have never won a competitive game at the stadium in 13 attempts.Defender Diego Godin says Atletico are in better shape than last time around, and thinks his side's team ethic, instilled into them by the charismatic Simeone, could prove key to winning their first European Cup.Godin told Uefa.com: Our big secret is the effort the team puts in.

"Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired, so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg-spinning great.The 24-year-old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one-day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off-spinner Nathan Lyon and slow-bowling all-rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa.Unheralded only a few months ago, Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league.A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February, Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League (IPL) at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants.His bowling action and run-up have been compared to Warne's, which has further fuelled the hype, but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end.""There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne,"" Zampa told Australian media.""The attributes he had, how strong he was, his leg-spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg-spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable.""People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run-up. It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way.""FAILED EXPERIMENTSSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007, Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg-spin.Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009, promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town.Early in his career, incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg-spinning all-rounder against England in the 2010-11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman.Left-arm wrist-spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again.Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August.Zampa, however, hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India, where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches.""The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving, I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing,"" he said.Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence, Guyana on June 5.",sports

"Soccer's five-times World Player of the Year Lionel Messi arrived at a court in Barcelona on Thursday to testify against charges of tax evasion.A few bypassers applauded the arrival of the Argentina and FC Barcelona player while several people shouted at him, but in contrast to when he appeared at a local court in 2013 to give evidence, there were no Barcelona supporters present.Messi and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, entered the court immediately without speaking to reporters.The trial began on Tuesday although Messi missed the first and second day, which he was not obliged to attend, citing a back injury sustained in Argentina's international friendly with Honduras last Friday.Lionel and Jorge Horacio Messi are accused by the Spanish tax office of defrauding the government of 4.2 million euros ($4.7 million) between 2007 and 2009.They could face jail terms of up to 22 months if found guilty, although it is customary in Spain that offenders of non-violent crime with a sentence of under two years do not serve time in jail.The case centres on the player's image rights and a web of shell companies allegedly used to evade taxes on income from those rights.Tuesday's hearing showed that Spain's tax office made 20 inspections of Messi during its three-year investigation.According to the prosecutors' office, revenue was hidden using shell companies in Uruguay, Belize, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.Messi and his father paid five million euros to the tax authorities as a ""corrective"" measure after being formally investigated in June 2013.Spain's tax office has also begun investigating the finances of Messi's Barcelona team-mates Neymar Jr, Javier Mascherano and Adriano.Mascherano accepted a one-year prison sentence for tax evasion as part of a plea bargain in January, although is not expected to serve time in jail.Messi moved to Barcelona from his birth place of Rosario, Argentina in 2000, becoming a Spanish citizen in 2005.He is 10th on Forbes Magazine's list of the world's highest-earning athletes over the past decade, with an estimated income of $350 million.Messi has scored 453 goals in 531 appearances for Barca in all competitions.He has also won eight La Liga titles, four King's Cups and four Champions League crowns with Barca, leading them to a league and cup double last season.Messi is also captain of Argentina and will rejoin the team immediately after his court appearance to prepare for the Copa America in the USA, playing their first game against holders Chile on Jun. 7.

"Novak Djokovic had 100 million reasons to celebrate reaching the French Open quarter-finals on Wednesday -- albeit two days later than expected -- as players finally cleared the fourth-round backlog created by the fickle Parisian weather.After relentless rain washed out all but two hours of play over the previous two days, under-fire Roland Garros organisers said such conditions had not been seen since 1873 as they frantically tried to play catch-up by staging 12 singles matches -- instead of just four quarter-finals as is the norm -- on day 11 of the sodden championships.That allowed world number one Djokovic to become the first tennis player to bank $100 million in prize money after his 3-6 6-4 6-1 7-5 win over Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut tipped him over the magic number.Having won a match that was originally scheduled for Monday, begun on Tuesday and completed on Wednesday, the 29-year-old Serb will have to play four days in succession if he is to reach Sunday's title showdown.""I have the feeling I played three matches against him,"" a grinning Djokovic told the crowd after donning a yellow rain hat during his victory speech.""Yesterday the match was interrupted three times and it wasn't easy coming here at 9 am and leaving at 7.30 or 8:00 pm.""So that's the reason why we should have the roof here,"" added the Serb, who joined the likes of golfer Tiger Woods and boxer Lennox Lewis in the $100 million club.However, rather than getting worked up about the French Open not having any court cover like the other three majors, it was the organisers' decision to make the players compete in misty rain on Tuesday that overshadowed Wednesday's on-court action.Serena Williams, who like Djokovic was bogged down in the fourth round for more than 48 hours, booked her place in the quarter-finals by walloping Ukrainian 18th seed Elina Svitolina 6-1 6-1. She will next face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva.In the bottom half of the men's draw, Andy Murray doused some early fireworks from Frenchman Richard Gasquet to win 5-7 7-6(3) 6-0 6-2 to set up a blockbuster semi-final against holder Stan Wawrinka. The Swiss beat Albert Ramos (Spain) 6-2 6-1 7-6(7).RAIN PLAY STILL A HOT TOPICBut the hot topic of the day remained what the organisers did, or did not do, on Tuesday.Djokovic's victim Bautista Agut said officials had ""pushed us to play two hours yesterday"" -- the threshold needed to avoid reimbursing money to ticket-holders -- while Venus Williams labelled the conditions ""really bad"" after being ambushed 6-2 6-4 by Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky.""The conditions were not playable yesterday. It's hard to see. The balls are wet, the courts are wet,"" said the American, whose defeat ended hopes of an all-Williams semi-final.French Open director Guy Forget defended the tournament's actions.""I understand that not refunding spectators .... has caused frustration and anger,"" he said.""If what we are being accused of were true, it would have been in our best interests to stop play before the one-hour, 59-minute mark as our insurer would have been responsible for ticket reimbursement.""However... our aim was to play for as long as possible, even if that meant being criticised for playing in difficult conditions.""Djokovic will be hoping he does not face another soggy day on Thursday when he is scheduled to contest his 28th successive major quarter-final against Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych, a 6-3 7-5 6-3 winner over 2013 runner-up David Ferrer.Austrian tyro Dominic Thiem was enjoying his most successful run at a grand slam after beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6-2 6-7(2) 6-1 6-4 to set up a last-eight clash with Belgian David Goffin.Venus Williams' eighth-seeded conqueror Bacsinszky, describing herself as ""a chameleon"" who can adapt to ""every type of court"", will next face Dutch outsider Kiki Bertens who downed American 15th seed Madison Keys 7-6(4) 6-3.Already in the semi-finals though are Spanish fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur.Fourth seed Muguruza ended the run of 108th-ranked American Shelby Rogers with a 7-5 6-3 win, while 2010 Paris finalist Stosur beat Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 6-4 7-6(6).",sports

"Indias Anil Kumble and several other former Test players on an International Cricket Council committee have urged the sports law-makers to bring in new restrictions on the size of bats amid concerns over a glut of run-scoring.Following a two-day meeting at Lords, the headquarters of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the ICC cricket committee chaired by Kumble issued a statement saying it wanted MCC, which still has overall global responsibility for crickets Laws or rules, to instigate a clampdown.While there are limitations on bat length (when the lower portion of the handle is inserted it shall not be more than 38in/96.5cm) and width (4.25in/10.8cm at its widest part), none currently exist on depth.Modern manufacturers have become increasingly skilled at making bats with larger sweet spots that do not feel as heavy to pick-up as the blades that were once only the preserve of 1980s power-hitters such as West Indies great Clive Lloyd and England hero Ian Botham.The balance between bat and ball has become especially loaded against bowlers in limited overs games where the innovations brought in by Twenty20 cricket, allied to increasingly short boundaries, have led to an orgy of run-scoring.Last years 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand witnessed 38 hundreds, nearly one every game, and 463 sixes, an average of one every nine overs.West Indies Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes in racing to the fastest one-day international double hundred during a World Cup match against Zimbabwe at Canberras Manuka Oval, while New Zealands Martin Guptill hit a six measured at 110 metres in the course of his 237 against the West Indies at Wellington.Thursdays statement from the ICC cricket committee, whose members include several former Test batsmen in Englands Andrew Strauss, Indias Rahul Dravid and Sri Lankas Mahela Jayawardene, said: ""MCC sought the committees guidance on the desirability of making changes in order to redress the balance between bat and ball.""The committee received a research paper from MCC citing a wealth of scientific and statistical evidence showing bats have become more powerful in recent years, primarily due to having larger sweet-spots.""It added: ""The committees view was that MCC should strongly consider limiting the dimensions of cricket bats to help achieve a better balance between bat and ball.""South Africa batting great Barry Richards, speaking during last years World Cup, said restrictions were urgently needed to bring modern-day bats into line with the kind of relatively slim models he used in his 1970s heyday.""The pressing of cricket bats has to be controlled and the thickness in their edges. Maybe there can also be a designated sweet-spot area for bats,"" Richards told the Sydney Daily Telegraph.""Ours used to be about the size of a 50 cent piece but now they are much bigger...

"World number ones Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams will feel like they are working overtime on Friday when organisers cram all four semi-finals into a single session to try and ensure a rain-ravaged tournament ends on schedule.The Serbian will be on court for a fourth day running and the American for a third, after the players' usual rest days between matches were eaten up by persistent rain delays that washed out Monday and meant just two hours of play were possible on Tuesday.The Serbian will also have to trade down to Roland Garros' number two court to battle past his young Austrian opponent, Dominic Thiem. The 13th seed has lost both their encounters but is strengthening his case with every win to be viewed as the pick of a new tennis generation.""He's playing the best tennis of his life,"" Djokovic told a news conference on Thursday after dispatching Czech Tomas Berdych in straight sets.""He's played a lot of matches, especially on clay, which is his favourite surface... I'm sure he's going to give it all in the semis.""Weather permitting, all semi-finals at grand slam tournaments are invariably played on the main showcourt, but the scheduling backlog means Djokovic and Thiem, and before them Spanish women's fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and Australian Sam Stosur, will play Friday's matches on Court Suzanne Lenglen.Taking pride of place on Paris' main Philippe Chatrier showcourt will be Williams and unseeded Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens, followed by arguably the most mouthwatering clash of the day between world number two Andy Murray and defending champion Stan Wawrinka.""I think he's been an amazing player for many, many years,"" Wawrinka told reporters about Murray, who has won eight of their 15 encounters.""He always tries to be a better player.

"Garbine Muguruza achieved the rare feat of overpowering Serena Williams to claim her maiden grand slam title with a 7-5 6-4 win over the world number one and defending champion in the French Open final on Saturday.The 22-year-old fourth seed, who lost to Williams in last years Wimbledon final, became the first Spaniard to lift the Suzanne Lenglen Cup since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998.""This is the big tournament in Spain and Rafa (Nadal) is our champion,"" she said courtside, referring to the nine-times mens winner who pulled out injured last week.""She won the first set by one point.That just goes to show you you really have to play the big points well and I think she played the big points really well,"" Williams said.Although her hard-hitting game seems more suited to faster surfaces, Muguruza won 14 consecutive sets en route to the final after losing her opening set of the tournament.An anxious player by her own admission, she managed her emotions on Court Philippe Chatrier, saving six of eight break points against Williams, who had only lost only four of her 26 previous major singles finals.It was Muguruzas first final on the slow surface and she relied on a powerful first serve and jaw-dropping winners down the line to subdue the American in a battle of will.Williams, who was gunning for a professional era record 22nd major title, got off to a solid start, winning her first service game to love and putting pressure on her opponents serve.In the fourth game, which lasted nine minutes, Muguruza saved a break point with an unreturnable forehand, then a second with an ace.An ugly double fault, however, earned Muguruza the first break of the match, which she consolidated by holding serve in the sixth game with a flat forehand winner down the line to lead 4-2.Williams, 34, stepped into the court and put Muguruza on the back foot, breaking back for 4-4 when Muguruza sent a backhand long.An unreturnable crosscourt forehand gave Muguruza another break.<br/>Serving for the set, she showed early nerves in the 12th game before converting her third opportunity with a sizzling backhand winner.A weak Williams backhand put Muguruza up a break in the second, only for the Spaniard to serve consecutive double faults as the American broke back for 1-1.But she unleashed another forehand down the line to regain the advantage and held for 3-1.Williams saved four match points to hold but on Muguruzas fifth opportunity to seal the contest in the following game she landed a lob on the base line and sank to her knees in apparent disbelief at winning the title.",sports

Today Garbine played unbelievable.""Its definitely something I want to dissect and see what I can learn from that and what can I do to get better from it.""<br/>Williams had struggled with an adductor injury at Roland Garros, a condition not helped by the unseasonal chill and damp.Despite that, she still finished top of the pile for aces served at 36 and sent down the joint fastest serve of the event at 196km/h in Saturdays final.But she had one of the lowest first serve percentage rates at 60% and managed to convert only 30 of 73 break points over the two weeks.The final, she suggested, was a reflection of her tournament as a whole.""It was just so many holes. Like I could have served better. I mean, I made a lot of errors on my return.""I did definitely try out there today, but did I play better than the other matches? Its a totally different game. But its going in the right direction, I think.""Williams believes Muguruza, the first Spanish woman since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998 to win a Grand Slam, has the game to build further on her Roland Garros breakthrough.""I think she has a bright future, obviously.

Thats what I used to love about Muhammad Ali.Khan added that Alis fighting style, which combined the speed and agility of a lightweight with the power of a heavyweight, had made him a unique fighter.If you looked at the way he used to fight he was very very different to any other fighter.He was a heavyweight, where he was really, really big, he was heavy. But he moved like a lightweight. So he floated like a butterfly and he did sting like a bee because his shots were fast, powerful and explosive. And he used to hurt his guys, you know, he hurt his opponents.In addition to being widely regarded as the best boxer in history, Ali was outspoken in his fight for social justice, becoming a key figure in the civil rights movement and a leading voice against the US war in Vietnam.He also raised millions of dollars for charity, including his own organisation dedicated to Parkinsons research, a disease he suffered from 1984 onwards.Khan said: I look up to him and I wanna do what he did. Thats why I come places like Pakistan and I spend time here.I kind of picked that out of his book  how Muhammad Ali used to help the less fortunate people.

"Boxing icon Muhammad Ali died on Friday, a family spokesman said in a statement.""After a 32-year battle with Parkinsons disease, Muhammad Ali has passed away at the age of 74,"" spokesman Bob Gunnell said.Ali, whose fame transcended sport during a remarkable heavyweight boxing career that spanned three decades, had been hospitalized in the Phoenix, Arizona, area with a respiratory ailment this week.Born in Louisville, Ky., in 1942, as Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., he began boxing at the age of 12, winning a number of amateur titles, culminating in an Olympic gold medal as a light heavyweight at the 1960 Games in Tokyo. He turned pro soon after that.Early in his career, he battled societal norms as frequently as he did his opponents. In 1964, as the struggle for civil rights simmered, he knocked out heavy favorite Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight title for the first time, then told reporters that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and had changed his name to Muhammad Ali, a name many news outlets at the time were slow to recognize.By 1967, he had successfully defended the title nine times, all but two by knockout. With the Vietnam War raging, he refused induction into the U.S. Army, on religious grounds, and was arrested and charged with draft evasion. When prodded further for his reasons for resisting, he said, I am not going 10,000 miles to help murder, kill, and burn other people to simply help continue the domination of white slave-masters over dark people the world over.Though he remained free on appeal, he was stripped of his title and not allowed to box for more than three years. The conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court, unanimously, in 1971. (A 2013 film by Stephen Frears, Muhammad Alis Greatest Fight, which dramatized the courts decision, debuted in Cannes, aired on HBO in the U.S., and earned an Emmy nomination.)During his exile from the ring, Ali decided to try acting, starring in the 1969 Broadway musical Buck White at the George Abbott Theatre. He played a militant black lecturer, and got better reviews than the show, which closed after seven performances. He sings with a pleasant slightly impersonal voice, acts without embarrassment and moves with innate dignity, wrote New York Times reviewer Clive Barnes.Alis boxing career was defined by his matches against top opponents, particularly rivals Joe Frazier and George Foreman. His 1971 bout with Frazier to unify the heavyweight championship, his third after being reinstated, was called the Fight of the Century. Among those in attendance at Madison Square Garden were Miles Davis, Barbra Streisand, and Sammy Davis Jr. Bert Lancaster was the color commentator for the closed-circuit TV feed. Life Magazine hired Frank Sinatra as the photographer for Norman Mailers story.Ali had exploded the era of humble sports heroes when he declared, I am the greatest! in the run-up to his title fight with Liston. He also was among the first athletes to trash-talk his opponents, and he called Frazier, who supported the war, an Uncle Tom. Frazier knocked down Ali in the 15th round, and won a unanimous decision.Ali had to wait three years for another shot at the championship, this time against Foreman, who had beaten Frazier so badly in taking the title that few gave the 32-year-old challenger a chance against the 25-year-old champ. Ali called the fight, held in Kinshasa, Zaire, the Rumble in the Jungle. In documenting the bout 22 years later, Gasts Oscar-winning When We Were Kings showed how an ebullient Ali had arrived on the scene a few days before the taciturn Foreman, and won over the nations citizens. An impromptu entourage of hundreds followed him around chanting, Ali, bomaye! (Ali, kill him!).In 1977, Ali lent his name to a short-lived NBC animated series I Am the Greatest!: The Adventures of Muhammad Ali. Somewhat more memorably that year, he joined Sylvester Stallone  whose Rocky was to win best picture  to present the best supporting actress award to Beatrice Straight for her role in Network.In the ring, a third, brutal fight against Frazier (the Thrilla in Manilla) as well as battles with Ken Norton subjected Ali to a great deal of punishment. And though he would become the first heavyweight to reclaim the title for a third time in 1978 at age 36, when he beat 25-year-old Leon Spinks in a rematch, the wear and tear of a career in boxing was apparent.He retired, and stayed that way for two years, but ill-advisedly returned for two more bouts, with Larry Holmes and Trevor Burbick, both cringe-inducing losses.In 1996, 12 years after his Parkinsons diagnosis, Ali, showing the effects of the disease, lit the torch to begin the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. In 2005, he was presented with the Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.Ali is survived by his fourth wife, Yolanda Lonnie Williams, two sons, and seven daughters, including Leila Ali, a boxer who retired, undefeated, in 2007.",sports
"Providence, Guyana: Sunil Narine snared career-best figures of six for 27 on his return to West Indies colours as the hosts defeated South Africa by four wickets in the opening match of the Tri-Nation One-Day International series at the Guyana National Stadium on Friday.Forced to remodel his action after it was deemed illegal during the Caribbean sides last ODI campaign in Sri Lanka last November, the 28-year-old mystery spinner was at his mesmerising best on a turgid surface where the South Africans were dismissed for 188 off 46.5 overs.They found it difficult to establish any sort of momentum despite two useful partnerships at the top of the order.Narines returns were not only a personal milestone but also the best-ever by any opponents in one-day cricket against South Africa.Kieron Pollard, back in the good graces of the West Indies selectors after 20 months in the ODI wilderness following the shock abandonment of the tour of India in October of 2014, then lifted his team to the target with 11 balls to spare with a robust unbeaten 67 that included six sixes.It was the first time in 15 years that the Caribbean side had defeated the South Africans in a one-dayer on home soil.Rilee Rossouw top scored with 61 and featured in a 78-run third-wicket partnership with skipper AB de Villiers.That effort followed an opening stand of 52 between Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla.However the Proteas collapsed from the comparative comfort of 160 for three, their last seven wickets falling for just 28 runs with Narine befuddling the South African middle and lower order.Rossouw was one of the spinners scalps, falling to a good low catch by Carlos Brathwaite at first slip.Brathwaite had earlier broken the opening stand of de Kock and Amla, de Kock attempting an injudicious heave to be comprehensively bowled.Narine then made his first strike by trapping Amla leg-before in the very next over.Yet it was the demise of de Villiers that proved to be the most crucial.Playing well within himself and being mindful of the challenging batting conditions, he compiled 31 off 49 deliveries without a single boundary but fell to a good catch off his own bowling by pacer Jerome Taylor at the start of the 31st over.South Africa had just ended a period of 23 overs without finding the boundary rope and it appeared de Villiers and Rossouw were on the cusp of acceleration before the captains departure.From then on it was the Narine show as he scythed through the rest of the visitors batting.Set a relatively modest target, the West Indies opening pair of Johnson Charles and Andre Fletcher rode their luck in a 37-run stand before the introduction of the spinners changed the complexion of the chase.Imran Tahir deceived and bowled both with googlies while Aaron Phangiso and part-timer J.P. Duminy removed Marlon Samuels and Denesh Ramdin respectively to have the hosts wobbling at 76 for four.But Pollard, whose first three scoring shots were towering sixes, dominated a 74-run fourth-wicket stand with Darren Bravo to take the West Indies closer to the target.Bravo fell to Phangiso for 30 and Carlos Brathwaite, the final over hero of the World T20 triumph in India two months earlier, perished attempting a bit hit of Phangiso.But captain Jason Holder joined Pollard to ensure there were no more alarms on the way to a morale-boosting victory for a team classified as underdogs alongside the South Africans and ahead of Sundays meeting with World Cup holders Australia at the same venue.",sports

"ISLAMABAD:Boxer Amir Khan has denied betraying his British upbringing after being criticised for saying he would represent Pakistan at the Rio Games, insisting he only wanted to boost the sport in his parents country of birth.But the Bolton-born fighter also admitted he would not be willing to face an accompanying two-year ban from the World Boxing Council that would jeopardise his professional career, making an Olympic appearance unlikely.Speaking to AFP in an exclusive interview in Islamabad, where he launched his first boxing academy on Saturday, Khan said he was a ""proud British fighter"" who had represented his country at the Athens Games and would therefore not want to deprive fellow Brits of a ticket to Rio De Janeiro.""Im not doing it because Im not happy being British. Im a proud British fighter, but its the way people took it out of context and calling me a traitor -- I meant it in a way that Id rather give someone else an opportunity instead because Pakistan has no boxers,"" he said.""But, you know, at the moment we are just waiting and seeing. I dont think Ill be allowed to do that anyway because obviously, the WBC, they wont allow it.""World Boxing Council president Mauricio Sulaiman denounced a rule change by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) to allow professionals to compete against top amateurs in the Olympics, calling the move dangerous.Amirs announcement was also met with consternation by some fans on social media and his former promoter Frank Warren, who wrote on boxingscene.com he was ""a little disappointed"" in Khan, who rose to fame after bagging an Olympic silver medal in 2004./>Stinging lossThe 29-year-old stands at a critical juncture in his career following a stinging loss to Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez last month, that took his career record to 31 wins and four losses.Khan, a two-time former welterweight world champion, stepped up two divisions to fight his brawny middleweight opponent after he was denied a coveted matchup with Floyd Mayweather, who retired last year.He got off to a lightning start, but after dominating the early rounds was caught with a powerful overhand right that put him on the canvas in the sixth.Looking more trim than he appeared during the Nevada bout, Khan was sanguine about his loss and insisted he was looking forward to his next world title shot against WBC welterweight champion Danny Garcia.""I feel great. I feel young, fresh. I mean, the Alvarez fight, everything was going fine until I got caught with the big shot and thats boxing for you sometimes. One punch can change the fight. You can be winning the fight quite comfortably and Ive seen it happen to the best of us.""So, Im gonna go back to the drawing board and not make those mistakes. I know that my offense was amazing in that fight. But maybe tighten up a few little areas.""/>Hunting for championsNo longer the brash youngster who was known for his fast cars and flashy lifestyle and who regularly made headlines for his speeding tickets, Khan now speaks passionately about the need to give back to those less fortunate -- a trait he says he learned from his idol, the late Muhammad Ali.Last year, he travelled to the Greek island of Lesbos to lead a charitable drive for Syrian refugees, while his current trip to Pakistan has seen him raise money and pledge wells for the residents of Thar, a drought-ridden southern district home to some of the countrys most destitute people.<br/>Ali, he says, was ""not just a champion but a peoples champion and thats how I want to be.""His academy in Islamabad -- modelled after the one he founded in Bolton, northwest England, will aim to seek out talent in a country which only boasts sporadic success in cricket.He said: ""I really believe in the country, I really believe in the talent we have here, just like I did in the UK.

"For Bob Arum, the famed promoter who befriended Muhammad Ali some 50 years ago, the former heavyweight champions legacy in the boxing ring pales in comparison to his impact on America and the world.Arum told Reuters on Saturday, the day after Ali died in a Phoenix-area hospital at the age of 74, that his long-time friend should be remembered for standing up against racism and war at a time when doing so was risky and unpopular.""I think when you talk about Muhammad Ali, as great an athlete, as great a boxer as he was, he was the greatest boxer of all time, he means so much more to the United States and the world,"" Arum said.""He was a transformative figure in our society. ""Arum, 84, recalled that Ali strode onto the world stage in the mid-1960s, at a time when African Americans were still fighting for basic civil rights.""And while Martin Luther King was talking sense and talking about progress that could be made in his soft-spoken way, Ali, with his big mouth was thundering and demanding rights for African-American people and standing up for what was right,"" Arum said.""At first that didnt sit well with the people in the United States. At fights he was booed because they felt that he was too outspoken,"" he said.Arum said he disagreed at the time with Alis refusal to be drafted into the U.S. Army and fight in Vietnam, a stand that cost the fighter his world boxing crown.""And I said hell no, I advised him just the opposite,"" Arum said. ""But of course he wouldnt listen.He did what he thought was right.And it turned out he was right, and I was wrong. ""The promoter said Ali gave up three years in the prime of his career to stand up for those convictions and was ultimately vindicated in the public eye.""So when I look back at his life, and I was blessed to call him a friend and spent a lot of time with him, its hard for me to talk about his exploits in boxing because as great as they were they paled in comparison to the impact that he had on the world,"" Arum said.",sports
"SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ: The death of Muhammad Ali, the former heavyweight champion known as much for his political activism as his boxing brilliance, triggered a worldwide outpouring of affection and admiration for one of the best-known figures of the 20th century.Ali, who had long suffered from Parkinson's syndrome which impaired his speech and made the once-graceful athlete almost a prisoner in his own body, died on Friday at age 74.The cause of death was septic shock due to unspecified natural causes, a family spokesman said on Saturday. Ali was admitted to a Phoenix-area hospital, HonorHealth, with a respiratory ailment on Monday.""Hell be remembered as a man of the world who spoke his mind and wasnt afraid to take a chance and went out of his way to be a kind, benevolent individual that really changed the world,"" the family spokesman, Bob Gunnell, said at a news conference in Scottsdale, Arizona.Despite Ali's failing health, his youthful proclamation that he was ""the greatest"" rang true until the end for millions of people around the world who respected him for his courage both inside and outside the ring.Along with a fearsome reputation as a fighter, Ali spoke out against racism, war and religious intolerance, while projecting an unshakeable confidence that became a model for African-Americans at the height of the civil rights era and beyond.Stripped of his world boxing crown for refusing to join the U.S. Army and fight in Vietnam, Ali returned in triumph by recapturing the title and starring in some of the sport's most unforgettable bouts.""I think when you talk about Muhammad Ali, as great an athlete, as great a boxer as he was, he was the greatest boxer of all time, he means so much more to the United States and the world,"" said Ali's long-time friend, boxing promoter Bob Arum.""He was a transformative figure in our society.""Bursting onto the boxing scene in the 1960s with a brashness that threatened many whites, Ali would come to be embraced by Americans of all races for his grace, integrity and disarming sense of humor.""In the end, he went from being reviled to being revered,"" civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday.Pam Dorrough, a tourist in New York's Times Square, admired Ali's refusal to apologize for what he believed.""The confidence - and I know everybody thought it was an arrogance about him - he always projected a confidence,"" she said. ""And he stood by that.""President Barack Obama, the first African-American to reach the White House, said Ali was ""a man who fought for us"" and placed him in the pantheon of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela.""His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail,"" Obama said in a statement. ""But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today.""Ali's daughter Maryum said on Saturday: ""I am happy my father no longer struggles. He is in a better place. God is the greatest.""In New York's Harlem district, fans gathered outside the famous Apollo Theater, where a marquee paying tribute to Ali read: ""The greatest of all time. 1942-2016.""Nearby, hundreds more gazed at projections of phrases and images most associated with Ali, such as ""float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.""Few could argue with his athletic prowess at his peak in the 1960s, with his dancing feet and quick fists. But Ali became much more than a sportsman. He spoke boldly against racism in the '60s as well as against the Vietnam War.Ali met scores of world leaders, during and after his championship reign, and for a time he was considered the most recognizable person on earth, known even in remote villages in countries far from the United States.",sports
"Mexico scored twice in the final five minutes to beat Uruguay 3-1 in a pulsating Copa America Group C match in which each side had a man sent off on Sunday.The win in front of a passionate and partisan crowd at Glendale, Arizona left Mexico top of the group on goal difference from Venezuela after they beat 10-man Jamaica 1-0 in Chicago.The early omens were not good for Uruguay who stood stunned before kickoff when the Chilean national anthem was played instead of their own.Mexico then made a lightning start with the fastest goal of the tournament so far in their first incursion into the Uruguay penalty area in the fourth minute.Hector Herrera and Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira both leapt to meet Andres Guardado's curling cross from the left with the defender heading into his own net.Uruguay, who had Matias Vecino dismissed on the stroke of halftime after a second booking for a foul on Jesus Corona, equalised in the 74th minute from the free kick awarded when Guardado was also shown a second yellow card.Carlos Sanchez, the man Guardado brought down, hit the free kick into the box where captain Diego Godin headed past Alfredo Talavera to put the record 15-times champions back on level terms.Mexico, however, had the last word when their captain Rafael Marquez scored a fine goal from a corner, finding the top corner of Fernando Muslera's net with an angled shot from the right.With the Uruguayans pushing forward in numbers in search of another equaliser, Herrera made the result safe in the second minute of added time with a header from Diego Perezs neat flick across the face of goal.VENEZUELAN VICTORYUruguay, without injured striker Luis Suarez and on the back foot for most of the first half, missed two good chances either side of halftime.Edinson Cavani, put through by Nicolas Lodeiro, was one-on-one with Talavera but the goalkeeper closed him down and blocked his effort after 30 minutes.In the 58th minute, Godin broke into attack from his own half and laid off to his right for Cavani who crossed to fellow striker Diego Rolan on the left but his finish was poor and ended up on the wrong side of the near post.Jamaica, who have now lost all four of their Copa America matches by the same 1-0 score, had the first chance at Soldier Field when a header from Je-Vaughn Watson hit the bar in the 11th minute.Venezuela, whose highest finish at a Copa America was the 2011 semi-finals in Argentina, went ahead after 15 minutes when Alejandro Guerra set up Josef Martinez and the striker shot under goalkeeper Andre Blake.Eight minutes later, Jamaicas Rodolph Austin was sent off after he caught Tomas Rincons ankle with his studs as he followed through after winning the ball in the tackle.Jamaica's coach Winfried Schaefer was sent to the stands for the second half after a heated discussion with referee Victor Carrillo at the break.The Caribbean islanders fought hard in the second half but Michael Hector hit the post with a shot and, at the other end, Blake needed to make a superb save from Wilker Angel's diving header.Mexico play Jamaica next in Pasadena on Thursday when Uruguay meet Venezuela in Philadelphia.",sports

"For Andy Murray, reaching Sunday's French Open final was a bonus, but he was in no mood to look for silver linings in the aftermath of yet another grand slam reverse at the hands of Novak Djokovic.The second-seeded Briton's 3-6 6-1 6-2 6-4 defeat on Court Philippe Chatrier was his fifth loss in seven blue riband finals against the Serbian world number one, and his eighth out of 10 finals in all.""I was struggling. I was a couple of points from going out of the tournament in the first round,"" he told reporters.""But then when you get there (to the final) obviously you want to win. You know, I didn't do that today. Right now I'm very disappointed.""Had he turned the tables on a player he has beaten just twice in the past 14 meetings, Murray would have become the first British man to win the French Open since Fred Perry in 1935.The last of those rare Murray victories came in May's Italian Open final, also played on clay -- a surface the Scot once mistrusted but now looks increasingly at ease on -- and in the same damp conditions that dominated this year's Roland Garros fortnight.Facing a Paris crowd heavily favouring his opponent in a stadium dotted on all sides with Serbian flags, the Scot managed to carry that momentum into the early part of Sunday's match -- one he said after his semi-final win over Stan Wawrinka that he had ""never expected to reach"".Murray won 16 of 20 points at one stage of the first set.But after failing to convert a break point in the first game of the second set, Murray lost the initiative and Djokovic kicked into a higher gear.The Serbian faltered only at the sharp end of the match, nervously dropping serve at 5-2 as the prospect of winning his fourth major in a row began to sink in, but sealing the match two games later.GRACIOUS AND WITTYWhen it was all over, Murray crossed the net to embrace his rival, well aware of the immensity of an achievement he paid tribute to in a gracious, witty courtside speech.""Winning all four of the grand slams in one year is an amazing achievement. This is something that is so rare in tennis,"" he said.""...So everyone here who came to watch is obviously extremely lucky to see it. Me personally being on the opposite side, it sucks to lose the match. But I am proud to have been part of today.""Murray acknowledged that same sense of perspective might help him view his achievements in a kinder light at the end of his career, having shared top-four billing over many years with Djokovic and two other all-time greats of the game in Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Federer missed this year's tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round.""Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me,"" he said.""But I guess I've got a few more years to try and (win more slams). I think when I finish I will be more proud of my achievements maybe.""Meanwhile next month's Wimbledon beckons, and another chance to set the record straight -- this time on a surface on which the Serbian has never beaten him.",sports

"Providence, Guyana: Australia wobbled near the finish yet still made an immediate statement in their opening match of the Tri-Nation Series at the Guyana National Stadium on Sunday, whipping the West Indies by six wickets in the second fixture of the tournament.Put in to bat on a pitch that once again made strokeplay difficult, the West Indies collapsed from the relative comfort of 50 for one to be dismissed for 116 off just 32.3overs, losing the last nine wickets for only 66 runs on the way their lowest-ever total in a One-Day International against Australia in the Caribbean.Australia then wasted little time in getting to the modest target, David Warner stroking an unbeaten 55 to ensure that the scheduled day/night fixture was over with almost 25 overs to spare despite the loss of three wickets for seven runs with the end in sight.Spinners Sunil Narine, with two wickets in one over, and Sulieman Benn caused the discomfort but it was not enough to pull the hosts back from the abyss.The emphatic victory earned Australia a bonus point to move ahead of the West Indies in the three-team standings before Tuesdays final game at Providence against South Africa.Boosted by a four-wicket win in the tournament-opener against the South Africans at the same venue two days earlier, the West Indies plummeted back down to earth at the feet of the World Cup-holders, whose frontline spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa did the bulk of the damage with three wickets apiece after the usual effective opening burst from Mitchell Starc.Playing his first international match for more than six months after being sidelined by injury, the left-arm fast bowler breached the defences of openers Andre Fletcher and Johnson Charles to finish with figures of two for 37 from nine overs.He showed signs of rustiness in delivering five wides and a no-ball, however his lethal pace proved more than a handful for the West Indies top order.Starcs tally of ODI wickets is now at 92 in his 47th match and should he take eight more before the end of this competition he will eclipse Pakistans Saqlain Mustaq for the record as the fastest to 100 wickets in terms of matches played in this format of the international game.Charles topscored with a chancy 22 while all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite was last out for 21, Aaron Finch taking the catch at long-on to give Zampa his third wicket.Notwithstanding the turgid surface, the home batsmen contributed to their swift demise with a succession of poor shots, exemplified by Darren Bravos loose cover-drive at seamer Mitchell Marsh which offered a straightforward catch to Zampa at cover.Lyon, the experienced off-spinner, had an almost instant impact in disposing of Marlon Samuels and Kieron Pollard off successive deliveries. Pollard, whose unbeaten 67 guided the West Indies to victory over the Proteas two days earlier, attempted a heave over long-on to be taken by Warner on the boundary.Jason Holder gave mystery spinner Narine first use of the new ball from one end in hopes of an immediate breakthrough at the start of the Australian reply, but it was left to the captain to separate the opening pair as Warner and Finch got off to a flying start with a succession of boundaries on both sides of the wicket.They had put on 44 by the eighth over when Finch was leg-before for 19 in Holders first over, giving the gangling Barbadian his 50th wicket in One-Day International cricket.",sports
"NEW YORK/The death of boxing great Muhammad Ali cost American Muslims perhaps their greatest hero, a goodwill ambassador for Islam in a country where their minority faith is widely misunderstand and mistrusted.""We thank God for him,"" Talib Shareef, president and imam of the Masjid Muhammad mosque in Washington, told a gathering of Muslim leaders who honored Ali in Washington on Saturday, a day after he died in a Phoenix hospital at age 74. ""America should thank God for him. He was an American hero.""From the turmoil of civil rights and black Muslim movements of the 1960s to the darkest days after Sept. 11, 2001, Ali was a hero that U.S. Muslims could share with part of the American mainstream.Muslims remembered Ali for many familiar reasons, hailing him as a champion of social justice, a lifelong supporter of charitable works and an opponent of the U.S. war in Vietnam.Moreover, they said, he was a Muslim that a largely Christian country came to admire, even if Ali shocked and scared much of U.S. society after he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay in 1964.""When we look at the history of the African-American community, one important factor in popularizing Islam in America is Muhammad Ali,"" Warith Deen Mohammed II, son of the former Nation of Islam leader, said in a statement.With some 3.3 million adherents in the United States, Muslims make up about 1 percent of the population, largely immigrants and African-Americans who have embraced the religion.Although they have integrated into society better than some of their brethren in Europe, American Muslims face hardships even as the United State grows demographically less white and less Christian.Since 2001, they have suffered backlash from those Americans who equate all Muslims with those who have attacked civilians out of some jihadist cause.Decades before, black Muslim leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X rattled the white establishment as religious and ethnic minorities who demanded equality for their people. Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races.Ali came to be widely revered, but there was a time when he was rejected, mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King, a Christian.""The sanitizing of Ali's image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces,"" said Frank Guridy, a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University.""He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America.""In the 1970s, Ali converted to Sunni Islam, the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide, and embraced Sufism, a mystical school of the faith.At the gathering of Muslim-American leaders in Washington, speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love.Ali defended Muslims last December, after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, California.""Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is,"" Ali said in a statement.He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian, a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison, and for Daniel Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002.""Muhammad Ali was a gift from God,"" said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, ""not only to Muslims but to the world.""",sports

"Neymar could follow FC Barcelona fellow star Lionel Messi to court after Spanish prosecutors asked for the Brazilian striker to be tried over his murky multi-million-euro transfer to the Catalan giants.Prosecutors from Spains top criminal court accuse the 24-year-old, his father, Barcas ex-president Sandro Rosell and the club itself of concealing the true cost of his 2013 transfer deal from Brazils Santos to FC Barcelona, a judicial source said Tuesday.If the case comes to trial, Neymar will be the second Barcelona star to take the stand after Lionel Messi appeared in court earlier this month on charges of tax fraud related to income earned from his image rights.Brazilian investment fund DIS, which held 40 percent of Neymars sporting rights when he played at Santos, claims it was cheated of its real share of the transfer due to parallel contracts that Barcelona and Santos allegedly used to hide the total cost.They also believe a pre-contract agreement between Neymar and Barca impeded other clubs from making offers for the player, affecting the value of the transfer fee.The deal was originally valued at 57.1 million euros ($64.9 million) by Barca, 40 million of which was paid to the N&amp;N company owned by the players father.Santos -- where Neymar started his career -- received 17.1 million, 6.8 million euros of which went to DIS.However, Spanish judicial authorities have estimated the number of simultaneous deals in the transfer amounted to at least 83.3 million euros -- with the difference allegedly going to Neymar and his family, and Santos.Rosell resigned from Barcelona in 2014 over the affair.The club was also indicted for alleged tax fraud linked to the signing, and made a voluntary tax payment of 13.5 million euros.So far though no trial has been held.- Corruption, fraud -The Brazilian football star and his father have in the past defended themselves in the media.""Before saying nonsense -- that we hid this, or hid that -- they should prove it,"" Neymar told Brazilian TV station Globo in February, when he was called to give evidence to a judge in Madrid.""My father is doing everything to ensure that I can just focus on playing football. He handles the books. But in the moment when you see someone you love suffering, it starts to hurt.""Prosecutors want Neymar, his father Neymar Da Silva Santos, Rosell and FC Barcelona itself to be tried for ""corruption,"" said the judicial source, who refused to be named.If the case comes to trial, Neymar faces a six-month to two-year prison sentence, as well as fines.Prosecutors also want Rosell, FC Barcelona, Brazils Santos and its president to be tried for ""fraud.""Neymars mother Nadine, meanwhile, could also be tried for having profited financially from the alleged fraudulent transfer.The player gave evidence to a judge in Spain in February as part of the probe into his transfer, as did his father.That same month, investigators in Brazil also launched proceedings against the football star and his father over the same case.Brazils federal prosecution service accused them of forging contracts to pay less tax.But a judge subsequently threw the tax fraud charges out, arguing that the case could not go ahead while tax authorities had yet to complete their probe.",sports

"England have knack of coming unstuck as they chase a Test series whitewash but they will hope to complete the job against Sri Lanka at Lords this week -- despite clear signs of improvement from the tourists.England are 2-0 up with one Test to play, but the match starting on Thursday has more riding on it than it might appear for the hosts after recent series victories ended on a low note.Last year, having won the Ashes, England suffered an innings and 46-run defeat by Australia in the fifth Test at The Oval.There was a similarly heavy reverse in South Africa in January when, 2-0 up with one to play, England lost the fourth Test at Centurion by 280 runs.Although they won the second Test against Sri Lanka in Chester-le-Street by nine wickets, there were warning signs for England during that success.Sri Lanka, having become the first team since New Zealand in 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, made 475 in the second knock in Durham -- including a fine hundred by Dinesh Chandimal.A typically good Lords pitch could make life harder still for fast bowlers in London, with the most even contest of the series so far in prospect.<br/> <br/> Englands two biggest doubts concern a pair of players who know Lords well as it is their Middlesex home ground.Top-order batsman Nick Compton has been struggling for runs, and fast bowler Steven Finn for wickets.With England having again selected a 12-man squad, it looks as if Compton will get another match at number three.Finns place is under threat from uncapped seamer Jake Ball, although England appear ready to retain the Middlesex quick.With England captain Alastair Cook now having completed the burdensome business of getting to 10,000 Test runs, the left-handed opener could be in the mood to make a major score at Lords.Meanwhile England new-ball duo James Anderson and Stuart Broad, first and third in the world Test bowler rankings respectively, will look to maintain their standing.Two years ago, Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews scored a fine Test century in a thrilling draw at Lords where the match went down to the last ball.For this fixture, Sri Lanka may make changes to their side.Stylish wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera -- a late addition to the squad after his drugs ban was overturned by the International Cricket Council because of a faulty lab analysis in Doha -- could end more than six months out by replacing injured all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana (twisted ankle).Fast bowler Shaminda Eranga was reported for a suspect action during the second Test and is understood to have undergone tests at the England and Wales Cricket Boards training centre at Loughborough University this week.Although Eranga is still available to play, Sri Lanka could give a debut to uncapped 29-year-old left-armer Chaminda Bandara in the absence of the injured Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera.",sports
"Diana Baig, the talented 20-year-old girl plays for Pakistans national team in both cricket and football. She represented the country as one of the ""Girls in Green"" at the recent World Twenty20 tournament in India, in between practicing her penalty shoot-out skills.She grew up playing street cricket and football with other children in the magnificent Hunza Valley, their makeshift arenas ringed by some of the worlds tallest mountains in northern Gilgit-Baltistan.Baig belongs to the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam, which largely freed her from the restrictions placed on other more conservative women in the Muslim country, where her gender is battling for greater freedom.From the streets, Baig began playing in community events and for local teams, and by 2010 she was leading the newly-formed Gilgit-Baltistan womens team.Two years later, she was selected for Pakistans A side, and then as a reserve player for the 2013 World Cup. In 2015, she finally won her first international cap, playing for Pakistan against Bangladesh.Her journey to the forefront of Pakistani womens football was even more dramatic.While playing cricket in Islamabad in 2010, Baig tried out for the Gilgit-Baltistan football team on a whim after friends told her they needed players.She made the team and, to her disbelief, in 2014 was selected to play for Pakistan at the SAFF Championships in Bahrain.She has been a member of the starting 11 as a defender ever since, she says, unable to hide her excitement.Baig has had to fight harder for her cricket career.Unlike in mens cricket, Pakistans womens players are not contracted and are selected on a match by match basis from lower-ranked teams, such as the several hundred playing at the provincial level.That means that there were times when Baig was in -- and times when she was out.Now Baig is fighting to maintain a crucial balance between her sporting dreams and education.""It becomes very hard,"" she says. ""I try to start from football... I play football in the morning, then our cricket training starts around 11 or 12 noon and continues until 3:00 pm or 4:00 pm.""After that, she says, she heads to her university hostel for food and drink. ""I start studying during the night, continuing until late.""With cricket taking up more and more time, her studies -- she is on a full scholarship at the university, where she is in her first semester of a health and physical education degree -- are suffering, Baig admits. ""But one has to manage it.""Though determined, she knows that one day she will have to choose. When asked which path she will take, she laughed.""You know, in Asia, there is more charm in cricket,"" she says, acknowledging her playing for the football team is the harder road.She adds: ""I see my future better in cricket.""",sports

"For someone who has spent six agonising months on the sidelines battling doping allegations, Sri Lankan Kusal Perera cannot think of a better place for his return than the hallowed turf of Lords in the third and final test against England on Thursday.The 25-year-old wicketkeeper-batsman was sent home from the tour of New Zealand in December after it was announced he had failed a drugs test last July.He was cleared last month when the International Cricket Council (ICC) dropped all charges against him after the Qatar-based laboratory that conducted the test withdrew its initial findings.Perera was not allowed to train with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) coaches and was called up in England only after a shoulder injury had ended paceman Dhammika Prasads tour.""I havent been told if Im playing yet but I was thrown into trouble and to come back from that at Lords would be a great opportunity,"" Kusal told reporters at Lords after practice on Tuesday.""I was banned just before a test, so to return in this format would be fitting.Even the time I was out of the team I knew I hadnt done anything wrong.But these things can happen in life.""Perera, who has played three tests and 51 one-dayers, admitted he arrived in England undercooked, having barely trained before a series he did not expect to be involved in.""I didnt have any time to think about whether I was in touch, or whether I could train, or even what was happening in cricket.""I started training the day after I was cleared.Before then I didnt do much batting -- just some fitness work.""Perera, however, felt he was fresh and striking the ball well, which might help his team salvage some pride after batting collapses in Leeds and Chester-le-Street helped the hosts open an unassailable 2-0 series lead.""I watched the attack and its mostly fast bowlers,"" he said of Englands bowlers.""In London, the conditions seem easier, because it must have been very cold in Durham.""When its cold you are a bit stiff and your feet dont work as well.With this weather and given the pitch as well -- which looks like it will be batting-friendly -- I think theres a chance for us to dominate them.""",sports
"PASADENA, United States: Colombia became the first side to reach the quarter-finals of the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday, while the United States thumped Costa Rica 4-0 to get their campaign back on track.Goals from AC Milans Carlos Bacca and Real Madrid star James Rodriguez secured a 2-1 win for Colombia over Paraguay in front of a vocal crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California.Victor Ayala gave Paraguay hope after pulling a goal back on 71 minutes but Colombia held on for three points which means they are assured of a top two finish in Group A and a place in the last eight.Colombia need only to draw against Costa Rica on Saturday to assure themselves of first place, leaving them a potentially easier quarter-final against the runner-up from Group B, which contains Brazil, Ecuador, Haiti and Peru.In Tuesdays other game, US striker Clint Dempsey scored his 50th international goal as the host nation bounced back from their 2-0 loss to Colombia on Friday with a convincing rout of Costa Rica.Dempsey opened the scoring from the penalty spot after nine minutes before Jermaine Jones and Bobby Wood struck just before half-time to effectively settle the contest.Substitute Graham Zusi added a fourth goal three minutes from time, which could prove crucial if goal difference comes into play.The win came as a welcome relief for US coach Jurgen Klinsmann, whose tenure has faced mounting criticism over the past 18 months after a series of disappointing performances in competitive matches.On Wednesday, Peru could join Colombia in the quarter-finals if they manage to defeat Ecuador in Glendale, Arizona in Group B.In Wednesdays other game, five-time world champions Brazil face an intriguing matchup against Caribbean minnows Haiti in Orlando, Florida.",sports
"PROVIDENCE, GUYANA: South Africa roared back into contention in the Tri-Nation One-Day International series with a 47-run victory over Australia in the third match of the tournament at the Guyana National Stadium on Tuesday.Defending a modest 189 for nine on another pitch that challenged the patience and technique of all batsmen, the Proteas bowlers were resisted only by opener Aaron Finchs defiant 72 before he was ninth out as the World Cup-holders folded for 142 off 34.2 overs.By virtue of their margin of victory, South Africa also earned a bonus point and leapt from last to first on net run-rate over Australia, leaving hosts West Indies third.Competition resumes in St Kitts on Saturday with South Africa and Australia renewing their rivalry at Warner Park.Farhaan Behardiens workmanlike innings of 62 held South Africas innings together and earned him the ""Man of the Match"" award. However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten 15 as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for 13 off seven probing overs.Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper-batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter-Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling. His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell, who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over.Playing his first ODI for almost 16 months, Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg-before.Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece, while Tabraiz Shamsi, the left-arm leggie, marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies.""We started well with the two seamers although this wasnt the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives,"" captain A.B. de Villiers said. ""(Tabraiz) Shamsi was a handful for their batters. I didnt see a lot of them picking him.""- Tough games coming up -Earlier, Australias fast bowling pair of Coulter-Nile and Josh Hazlewood proved most effective with two wickets each in restricting the Proteas after de Villiers surprisingly chose to bat first on winning the toss.""We didnt adapt well enough with the bat today,"" was Smiths assessment of his teams reply. ""Weve got a couple of tough games ahead of us now and we have to improve on this effort.""Coulter-Nile, who replaced Mitchell Starc from the opening victory over West Indies two days earlier, made the most of the opportunity with a spell of two for 38 off 10 overs.He claimed the vital wickets of de Villiers and J.P. Duminy in consecutive overs to reduce the South Africans to 104 for five midway through the innings, effectively killing off any realistic chance they had of posting a formidable total.Hazlewood was even more economical in conceding 20 runs off 10 metronomic overs. He earned an LBW verdict against Quinton de Kock to break the opening partnership with Hashim Amla and returned to get rid of Parnell.South Africa entertained hopes of a challenging total when de Villiers and Amla were at the crease. The two most experienced batsmen in the side put on 40 for the third wicket before Amla was run out for the third time in ODIs against Australia.Wickets continued to fall regularly thereafter and it was left to the lower-order players Phangiso and Rabada to assist Behardien in lifting the South Africans closer to the 200-run mark.",sports

"PHILADELPHIA: Uruguay were sent crashing out of the Copa America Centenario on Thursday as Venezuela and Mexico marched into the quarer-finals.Uruguay, the record 15-time Copa America champions, were eliminated in the group phase for the first time since 1997 after slumping to a shock 1-0 loss to Venezuela in Philadelphia.That result combined with Mexicos 2-0 Group C win over Jamaica in Pasadena left the 2011 champions struggling to digest a humiliating early exit.Uruguays defeat also capped a miserable tournament for Barcelona superstar Luis Suarez. Suarez, nursing a hamstring injury when he joined up with the squad, has so far not played a single minute.Suarez appeared in the dugout and looked visibly frustrated at his failure to get on the pitch, at one point appearing to punch the dugout wall.Venezuelas winner came on 36 minutes, when midfielder Alejandro Guerra cleverly spotted Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera off his line.Guerra unleashed a long-range effort from near the halfway line which the back-pedalling Muslera could only parry onto the bar before Salomon Rondon bundled in the rebound.Venezuelas advance to the last eight is the biggest shock of the tournament so far.<br/> The Venezuelans are currently bottom of South Americas 10-team round robin qualifying competition for the 2018 World Cup; Uruguay are on top of the standings. <br/> <br/> Venezuela will now face Mexico in their final first round game to determine who finishes top of Group C.Mexico, who had beaten Uruguay 3-1 in their opening game, meanwhile proved too powerful for Caribbean minnows Jamaica in front of an 83,263 crowd at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.With Californias large population of Mexican-Americans making it a virtual home game for El Tri, Mexico took the lead on 18 minutes when former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Javier Hernandez nodded in his 45th international goal.Jamaica were denied what looked like a clear-cut penalty in the second half after striker Clayton Donaldson appeared to have been fouled in the area.The drama came in the 60th minute when Donaldson rounded his marker before being cut down by Yasser Corona.

"Jonny Bairstow continued a brilliant year of run-scoring with a Test-best 167 not out against Sri Lanka at Lords on Friday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 162 for one in reply to Englands first innings 416, a deficit of 254 runs.Kaushal Silva was 79 not out and Kusal Mendis unbeaten on 25 after left-handed opener Karunaratne made exactly 50.Considering the start of this series saw Sri Lanka become the first side since 1958 to be dismissed for under 120 in three successive Test innings, this was a fine effort.There had been signs of recovery in their last innings, where Sri Lanka made 475 in a nine-wicket defeat in the second Test, giving England an unassailable 2-0 lead in this three-match series.Karunaratne should have been out for 28 on Friday when he nicked all-rounder Chris Woakes, only for Bairstow to drop the two-handed waist-high chance.Karunaratne cashed in and after tea struck James Anderson, the worlds number one ranked Test bowler, for three fours in as many balls, including a well-hit drive.Yet having completed a 95-ball fifty, Karunaratne was dismissed when a leg glance was well caught by a diving Bairstow to give under-pressure fast bowler Steven Finn a wicket on his Middlesex home ground.Karunaratnes exit ended an opening stand of 108 with Silva -- easily Sri Lankas best top-order partnership of the series.Silva took Sri Lanka to 150 with a sublime drive through extra-cover for four off Stuart Broad.It wasnt until January that the 26-year-old Bairstow scored his first Test century.<br/> But since January 1 he has been in prolific batting form for both county champions Yorkshire and England, scoring 594 runs at an average of 118.8 in Tests and 1,127 runs in first-class cricket at 102.4.Friday saw Bairstow receive good support from Woakes (66) in a seventh-wicket partnership of 144.Meanwhile, Sri Lanka left-arm spinner Rangana Herath took an economical four for 81 in 36 overs.England resumed on 279 for six with Bairstow 107 not out and Woakes unbeaten on 23.Bairstows second century of the series, following his 140 on his Headingley home ground in the first Test, helped rescue England from the depths of 84 for four.Woakes was the initial aggressor on Friday and a boundary off Eranga saw him to a maiden Test fifty in 102 balls. But Woakes fell when caught and bowled by Herath off a chipped drive.Bairstow batted on and his leg-glanced four off Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews saw him surpass his previous Test-best 150 not out against South Africa at Cape Town in January.",sports
"Former West Indies cricketer Franklyn Rose, who was deported from New Zealand earlier this year, has claimed the country is not safe for international cricketers ""especially if they are black"".Rose, who was the subject of a sex assault complaint while living in the country, told Television New Zealand on Saturday he was racially stereotyped by police.The sex assault investigation was eventually dropped with no charges laid and the 44-year-old was deported in April for overstaying his visa having spent his final weeks in prison.Rose, who played 19 Test matches for the West Indies between 1997-2000 and is now back in Jamaica, had been in New Zealand since 2011 on a work visa to play and coach in Auckland.""You cannot invite someone to your country to play and coach cricket, then throw him in jail for no reason, then kick him out of your country,"" he said.""What have I done to be locked in a prison cell for seven weeks? I felt so terrified and nervous when I realised I was living with and amongst serial killers, rapists and drug dealers.""Rose said he has written to the International Cricket Council stating ""New Zealand is not a safe place for international cricketers, especially if they are black"".He said he would have left New Zealand earlier had he not ended up in hospital after being assaulted in November 2012.While in hospital recovering from his wounds, Rose developed a blood clot in his lungs which prevented him from flying, he said, saying this was the reason he remained in the country for as long as he did.Police superintendent Bill Searle said police ""strongly refute"" Roses claim that the assault was not investigated properly, and that the investigating officer ""racially stereotyped"" him.""A full and thorough investigation was carried out into Mr. Roses reported assault,"" Searle said.""Mr. Roses version of events was not able to be corroborated. Mr. Rose was advised of the outcome of his case and thanked the investigating officer.""Searle said Rose never complained to the police about his treatment and he later ""extended an invitation to the investigating officer to bring other members of police to attend a promotional event at a bar"".Searle said now Rose had made the sex assault complaint public, he could confirm the cricketer ""was the subject of a police investigation earlier this year, in relation to sexual assault"".""No charges were laid.

"CHICAGO: Lionel Messi scored a magical hat-trick in 19 minutes as Argentina cruised into the Copa America Centenario quarter-finals with a 5-0 rout of Panama on Friday.Messi had been forced to delay his debut in the tournament after a slow recovery from a lower back injury, with Argentina coach Gerardo Martino surprisingly naming him amongst the substitutes once more.But Messi wasted no time in stamping his genius on the tournament after coming on in the 61st minute to replace Augusto Fernandez with Argentina leading the Group D game 1-0.An electrifying cameo from the Barcelona superstar began with his first goal of the tournament on 68 minutes, finishing with aplomb after Gonzalo Higuains shot bounced off a Panamanian defender into his path.But there was no question of luck with his second, with Messi curling a wonderful free-kick into the top corner to bring the Soldier Field crowd to its feet in the 78th minute.With Panamas heads down, Messi then duly completed his quick-fire hat-trick -- skipping clear of a marker inside the penalty area to finish emphatically for 4-0.There was still time for Messi to have a hand in Argentinas fifth goal of the evening, providing a sublime pass in the build-up to Sergio Agueros close range headed effort in the 90th minute.Agueros Manchester City team-mate Nicolas Otamendi had opened the scoring for Argentina in the seventh minute, heading home an Angel Di Maria free-kick from close range.The victory sees Argentina, convincing 2-1 winners over Chile in their opening game, guaranteed a spot in the last eight with one group game remaining.The only blemish on the evening was an injury to Angel Di Maria, who limped off in the first half to extend his miserable record of injuries in major tournaments.Argentina are now firmly on course to top Group D, with only one game against pointless Bolivia to come.Fridays win marked a dazzling return to the spotlight for Messi, who is determined to help lead Argentina to their first major international tournament victory for 23 years.Messi, a veteran of Argentinas agonizing defeats in the 2014 World Cup final and 2015 Copa America final, had arrived in the United States nursing a back injury sustained during a friendly victory against Honduras last month.He was late joining up with the squad after returning to Spain to give evidence in his tax fraud trial.",sports

"Muhammad Alis hometown Louisville on Friday said farewell to the boxing legend and civil rights hero, with thousands lining the streets for an emotional procession and thousands more packing a sports arena for a star-studded memorial service.The public ceremony, which began with a Quranic chant, capped two days of remembrance honoring the three-time heavyweight world champion known as ""The Greatest,"" who died last week at 74 after a long battle with Parkinsons disease.Former president Bill Clinton and comedian Billy Crystal were to eulogize the legendary fighter, after a funeral procession through Louisville, the largest city in the southern state of Kentucky where Ali was born at a time of racial segregation.Fans lining Louisvilles streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse carrying Alis remains were in a festive mood -- taking photos, cheering, applauding and chanting Alis name in the bright sunshine. Some even wore boxing gloves.The route covering about 18 miles (30 kilometers) passed by sites important to ""The Champ"": his childhood home, the Ali Center, the Center for African American Heritage -- which focuses on the lives of blacks in Kentucky -- and along Muhammad Ali Boulevard before arriving at the Cave Hill Cemetery for a heros burial.Spectators threw red roses and other flowers onto the hearse, blocking much of its windshield by the time it reached the cemetery. A fleet of limousines transporting Alis family and close friends followed in the cortege.Police officers jogged alongside the hearse as it passed Alis boyhood home, to keep the large crowd out of the street.""The kids love him, hes always stood for hope in this neighborhood,"" Toya Johnson, who wore an Ali T-shirt, told AFP.""For the youth here, he is an example.""Born Cassius Clay in 1942, the boxer won Olympic gold and went on to a glorious professional career, with his epic fights -- like the ""Rumble in the Jungle"" with George Foreman and the ""Thrilla in Manila"" with Joe Frazier -- now the stuff of sports legend.He shocked America by refusing to serve in Vietnam, a decision that cost him his title and his career for years.

"Croatia needed a touch of Luka Modric magic to beat Turkey 1-0 in their Euro 2016 Group D opener on Sunday, gaining a measure of revenge after their bitter quarter-final elimination by the same opponents at Euro 2008.Inspirational playmaker Modric put Croatia in front with a fine volley from 25 metres that bounced in front of diving Turkey goalkeeper Volkan Babacan shortly before halftime of a tense affair at Parc des Princes.The Real Madrid midfielder, who missed the opening penalty for Croatia in the 2008 shootout, made amends with an impressive display, organising his side with calm authority.A cloud of smoke after the goal suggested flares had been launched from a section of the stadium packed with Croatia fans. A smoke bomb was later thrown in behind the Croatia goal.No other incidents were reported in a game under tight scrutiny after the ugly scenes that marred Saturday's match between England and Russia in Marseille.Technically the better side, the Croatians, who had one foot in the last four eight years ago until they fell to Turkey on penalties, kept alive their hopes of surviving a tough group also featuring holders Spain and the Czech Republic, who face each other in Toulouse on Monday.Turkey, who had failed to qualify for a major tournament since their impressive Euro 2008 campaign, now face a struggle to reach the knockout stages.Turkey looked nervous in the opening stages and Croatia dictated the pace, with Modric, named man of the match, and Ivan Rakitic pulling the strings in midfield.The game was lively but with no clear chance for either side until Croatia midfielder Milan Badelj offered the first shot on target with a volley from 20 metres that failed to surprise Babacan.Seconds later, Turkey threatened for the first time with a header by Ozan Tufan from a fine Gokhan Gonul cross.The game became scrappy with quite a few fouls, notably from Turkey, and Croatia defender Vedran Corluka had to play most of the match with a bandaged, bleeding head after being elbowed by striker Cenk Tosun while fighting for a high ball.Croatia looked in command after the break and created a few opportunities, notably when captain Darijo Srna rattled the crossbar from a free kick after Rakitic was brought down outside the box.Playing a major tournament in France brings back sweet memories for Croatia, who lost in the semi-finals of the 1998 World Cup to host nation France before beating the Netherlands to finish third.",sports

"Nuwan Pradeep took three wickets and did some serious damage to a couple of England careers as Sri Lanka fought to avoid a series whitewash in the third Test at Lords on Saturday.England in their second innings were 109 for four at the close of the third day, a lead of 237 runs. Alex Hales was 41 not out, having been dropped on 19 and 39, with nightwatchman Steven Finn, missed on one, unbeaten on six.England, 2-0 up in the three-match series, were rocking at 50 for three before first-innings century-maker Jonny Bairstow helped Hales add 52 for the fourth wicket.However Pradeep had Nick Compton out for 19, caught behind tamely pushing at Shaminda Eranga.Compton had been promoted to open in place of England captain Alastair Cook, after the left-hander suffered a knee injury fielding close in earlier on Saturday.England were now 45 for one and that quickly became 50 for three. Joe Root (four) was bowled by an absolute shooter from Pradeep. New batsman James Vince was out for a golden duck as he deliberately played no shot to a Pradeep delivery that nipped back down the Lords slope and knocked over his off stump.Bairstow, in at 84 for four in the first innings before making a Test-best 167 not out, survived the hat-trick. But on 32 he too was clean bowled by Pradeep.Pradeep ended the day with three for 25 in nine overs but his figures could easily have been better.Earlier, England all-rounder Chris Woakes started and finished a collapse that saw Sri Lanka, 162 for one overnight, dismissed for 288. That gave England, who made 416 in their first innings, a lead of 128.Woakes, who took a wicket with his first ball Saturday, ended the innings with the opening delivery of a new spell when Eranga was caught in the slips.<br/> Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes took three for 31 in 17.1 overs.Sri Lanka resumed Saturday with Kaushal Silva 79 not out and Kusal Mendis 25 not. But they both fell for their overnight scores as Sri Lanka subsided in the face of increasingly accurate fast bowling, with the overcast conditions making batting harder than had been the case on Friday.Woakes had Mendis lbw with his first ball Saturday before Silva was caught behind off Stuart Broad.Kusal Perera (42) and Rangana Herath (31) checked Englands progress with a seventh-wicket partnership of 71.Pereras bold innings was particularly impressive as this was his first match in more than six months after a drugs ban was rescinded because of a botched analysis. He was eventually caught behind after wildly slogging at James Anderson to start a slump that saw Sri Lanka lose all their last three wickets on 288.",sports
"St. Kitts: Opening batsman David Warner made his first one-day international (ODI) century outside Australia to set his team on their way to a 36-run victory over South Africa in the fourth match of a triangular ODI series on Saturday.After Australia made a respectable 288 for six off their allotted 50 overs, South Africa looked to be cruising to victory for much of their innings at Warner Park in Basseterre, on the Caribbean island of St Kitts.However, a persistent Australian bowling attack finally took its toll and South Africa collapsed from 210/3 in the 38th over to lose their final seven wickets for only 42 runs and were all out for 252 off 47.4 overs.Warner made 109 from 157 balls on a pitch that, initially at least, was far more conducive to runs than the slow, low surface that hosted the first three games of the series in Guyana.It was his sixth ODI century, with his previous five coming on home soil.<br/> He later injured a finger diving for a catch and left the field for treatment.The result leaves Australia with two wins from three matches, while South Africa has one win from three.West Indies have one win from two matches, ahead of their game against Australia in St. Kitts on Monday.Fast bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood and spinner Adam Zampa took three wickets each for Australia.Hazlewood picked up the prized wicket of South African captain AB de Villiers (39) with a superb delivery that swung late, beat the inside edge and collected middle stump.It proved to be the turning point of the match as de Villiers departed to leave South Africa 210/4, after which it all went awry for the Proteas.",sports

""We had a situation where we were open -- it was a game we did not want.""Germany will draw confidence from Schweinsteiger's never-say-die attitude, with the holding midfielder's presence crucial to the team's overall spirit.Schweinsteiger has been injured for months, with his very participation in the Euros in doubt, and his goal could not have come at a better time to inspire the squad as they bid to win the competition for the fourth time.""We know now that we have to raise our level and hopefully we will do it for Poland,"" said Neuer.",sports

"Sri Lanka Cricket will lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against an ""unacceptable"" reprieve for England batsman Alex Hales in the third and final test at Lord's, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala has said.Nuwan Pradeep clean bowled Hales, then on 58, in England's second innings on Sunday but it was adjudged a no-ball by umpire Rod Tucker, even though replays suggested a fraction of the paceman's shoe was behind the popping crease.Hales capitalised on the reprieve to score 94 before he was finally dismissed but his reprieve prompted the visitors to briefly unfurl a Sri Lankan flag from the balcony in a perceived mark of protest.""The management on tour is very sad about that decision and it will be reported to the ICC,"" Sumathipala, who termed it ""unacceptable"", said.Coach Graham Ford, who complained to match referee Andy Pycroft after Sunday's play, played down the unfurling of the flag by the team, who have already surrendered the three-test series after crushing defeats in Leeds and Durham.The SLC chief, however, saw it differently.""The flag is a symbol,"" Sumathipala said. ""It is a mark to say we are not happy with the decision. (It was unfurled) To show solidarity and fight back.""Ford said Tucker had apologised for the mistake and the coach was of the view that front-foot no-ball calls should be taken out of the on-field umpire's hand.""It just seems strange that with the technology that is available you can get a line call wrong,"" Ford said.""You'd think the best solution would be for the umpires to worry about what's going on down the other end and for technology to look after the line call.""Meanwhile, England paceman James Anderson was reprimanded for ""conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game"" during the match, the ICC said in a statement.Anderson was guilty of showing disrespect to umpire S Ravi, who had asked the paceman not to verbally engage with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath during the visitors' first innings.Sri Lanka resume Monday's final day on 32 for no loss, needing 330 more runs to salvage some pride in the series in which they have been thoroughly outplayed.",sports
"St. KITTS: Australia vice-captain David Warner has a fractured left index finger, the team announced on Sunday.Opening batsman Warner suffered the injury while fielding during Saturdays victory over South Africa in the triangular one-day series in St Kitts.""We will assess the situation over the coming days to see if the injury requires a surgical option but should that not be the case then David is likely to be available to return to play in somewhere between two and six weeks,"" team doctor Geoffrey Verrall said in a statement.The final of the triangular contest, which also includes the host West Indies, will be played on June 26, which seems to rule Warner out for the rest of the series.The injury comes as the left-hander is in some of the best form of his career.Warner was named man of the match on Saturday after completing his first ODI century outside Australia, a knock of 109 off 120 balls at the appropriately-named Warner Park.Just two weeks ago he captained Sunrisers Hyderabad to victory in the final of the Indian Premier League.Warner is looking at the positives of his enforced absence after a busy stretch of cricket.""Its obviously disappointing to be sidelined given the form Ive been in (but this) will give me the chance to freshen up and spend quality time with my family after an intense period of action.""Australia lead the triangular series with two victories from three games.<br/> They next meet West Indies in St Kitts on Monday.",sports
"Stand-in centre back Shkodran Mustafi headed his first goal for Germany and Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in stoppage time as the world champions survived several scares to beat Ukraine 2-0 in their opening Euro 2016 Group C match on Sunday.Mustafi, who started in the absence of regular centre back Mats Hummels, rifled home a header after 19 minutes to give Germany the lead, which was not extended until Schweinsteiger, a 90th-minute substitute, swept home from close range.Germany, bidding for a fourth Euro triumph but first since 1996, dominated possession, but also relied on three top saves from keeper Manuel Neuer and a goal-line clearance by Jerome Boateng to come out on top.Ukraine, playing in their second European championship, harried and hustled their opponents and their tight defence offered few clear sights of goal to the Germans.Yet lone striker Roman Zozulya was unable to offer much threat, except at the very start and in the closing stages as Ukraine pushed on in search of an equaliser.In a breakneck first half, Ukraine's Yevhen Konoplyanka forced Germany keeper Neuer to make a flying save in the fourth minute before the Germans steadily took control, with Toni Kroos orchestrating most of their attacks.It was from his free kick, that Mustafi, who last featured for Germany in March and only made the side because Hummels was recovering from a muscle injury, leapt behind Serhiy Sydorchuk to power in a header.Ten minutes later Sami Khedira had the chance to double Germany's lead as Kroos floated a ball beyond the defence, but he shot straight at the keeper.By then though, the Ukrainians had woken up and, driving their full backs higher up the pitch, forced Neuer to punch over a strong header from Yevhen Khacheridi.Boateng was then forced into a dramatic clearance, having first lost the ball before hacking it clear while back-pedalling into the net. Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime.Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half, relying on hopeful long balls forward, while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long-range effort from Khedira, a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil, when he was through on goal.Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer's head, leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net, while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process.Then, in the final seconds, with Ukraine pushing up, Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score.The result extended Germany's unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship.Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday, when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon.Several hours before the match, German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille, though police quickly brought the situation under control.",sports
"Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no-ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lords on Sunday.At stumps, Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings, needing a further 330 runs on Mondays fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362.More realistically, their goal was to prevent England, already 2-0 up in the three-match series, taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash.But England captain Alastair Cook, 49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding, may not have been able to declare his sides second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lankas way instead.Significantly, Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales -- who went on to make 94 -- out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep. But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no-ball. Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no-ball call by an umpire and Hales survived.In February, a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no-ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth.Under International Cricket Council regulations, the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations.There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said: ""The ICC have to look at it.""It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong,"" the South African added.""The best solution is for the umpires to worry about whats happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call. ""The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down. That was a kick we didnt need.""The Sri Lanka management reacted to Haless reprieve by draping the national over the tourists dressing-room balcony for some 45 minutes.Ford said this wasnt so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle.""At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale --only for us to find out thats not the done thing and we had to take it down,"" said Ford.He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake.""He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo. It was very good of him to have done that and we move on.""Hales, for all his good fortune Sunday, was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred.The Nottinghamshire opener, out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests, got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium-pacer Mathews.Somewhat ironically, in view of Sri Lankas earlier protest, Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists favour on this occasion.""Its disappointing again to come so close,"" said Hales, whose 126-ball innings included 10 fours and a six.""But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck -- bowled off a no-ball, umpires calls and edges -- I guess the luck ran out.""",sports
"Substitute Raul Riudiaz's hotly disputed goal earned Peru a shock 1-0 win over Brazil in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Sunday, the defeat knocking the five-times world champions out the Copa America at the group stage.The Peruvian forward appeared to use his hand to score from close range with 16 minutes remaining and after a long delay while the referee consulted with his assistant while taking advice through an earpiece, he allowed the goal to stand.Television pictures showed Ruidiaz grinning after the goal had been awarded but the Brazilian players were apoplectic with rage at a decision that sent them tumbling out of the tournament before the knockout stages for the first time since 1987.""We saw that the ball hit his hand but you can't complain,"" Brazil centre half Miranda told reporters. ""(The referee) said he discussed it with four officials and that they didn't see the handball.""Brazil tried from the first minute to score but the ball didn't want to go in unfortunately, and that's football.

"Ireland can take encouragement from a 1-1 draw in their Euro 2016 Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents' desire.Ireland were the better team and Sweden were fortunate to grab an equaliser when Irish defender Ciaran Clark headed a cross into his own goal after Wes Hoolahan had opened the scoring with a splendid strike early in the second half.It was another misfortune for Ireland at the Stade de France, where they were playing for the first time since Thierry Henry's infamous handball for France led to a goal that crushed the 2010 World Cup qualifying dreams of the Irish in a playoff.Monday's match was probably the one the Irish and Swedes had targeted for a win in a section that also features traditional European force Italy and a talented Belgium side.Martin O'Neill's Boys in Green, however, can be more optimistic than Erik Hamren's Blue-Yellows, who did not manage a single shot on target despite the efforts of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was kept fairly quiet by Ireland's defence.""We have two very, very tough matches coming against two sides that are very classy,"" said O'Neill.""But if I can take anything from the performance today, it was that the players looked accomplished. We have the desire but the players are growing into international football.""Both teams were backed by hordes of fans and the yellow and green armies brought a festive touch to the Stade de France, in sharp contrast with the violence that has marred the tournament.O'Neill's side showed a real desire to win, making two attacking substitutions after Sweden's equaliser, while the Scandinavians looked slow and toothless until Ireland took a deserved lead three minutes after the break.Hoolahan struck a superb half-volley into the net from Seamus Coleman's perfect cross into the area triggering a roar rarely heard in the usually subdued Stade de France.MATCH-WINNING CHANCEThat acted as a wake-up call for Sweden, who were relying on their enigmatic 34-year-old captain Ibrahimovic.""I came like a king, left like a legend,"" Ibrahimovic quipped as he left Paris St Germain at the end of last season after helping them win a second straight domestic treble.He was certainly neither when he returned to Paris on Monday.In the first half, Ibrahimovic looked lost on a pitch where which he won two French Cup and two League Cup trophies and, while he produced the cross that led to Ireland's own goal, the striker failed to convert a chance in the closing stages.In the 71st minute, Ibrahimovic made a rare break down the left flank into the area and his cross was headed into his own goal by the unfortunate Clark.Twelve minutes later, however, Ibrahimovic just failed to connect as Martin Olsson's cross whizzed in front of him, missing the chance to score an almost certain winner albeit undeserved.""The feeling right now is disappointment rather than coming back for a draw,"" said Hamren.""For the first 50 minutes Ireland were better.

West Indies next play South Africa on Wednesday at the same venue.Samuels had joined Darren Bravo at the crease following a rollicking opening stand of 74 in ten overs before all-rounder James Faulker removed Fletcher for 27 while Zampa trapped Charles in front for 48.Bravo and Samuels then steadied the West Indies chase, keeping them well on course in an 82-run third-wicket partnership that was broken when Zampa removed Bravo for 39 via at bat-pad catch that lobbed comfortably to wicketkeeper Matthew Wade.Earlier, Khawajas promotion to open the batting in the absence of the injured David Warner paid immediate dividends.He lost Aaron Finch in the very first over to West Indies captain Jason Holder but then featured in a 170-run second-wicket partnership with Smith, who overcame the nagging discomfort of a right leg injury to help put his team in a commanding position by the time he departed in the 35th over, the victim of a clever change of pace from all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite.Khawaja was on the verge of a maiden ODI hundred but, becalmed in the nineties, he took on the challenge of a third run for his third-wicket partner, Bailey, and was found short of his ground by Jerome Taylors return from the boundary to stand-in wicketkeeper Fletcher. His innings occupied 123 deliveries and was embellished by three sixes and four fours.Fletchers position behind the stumps was the result of an injury to Ramdin who fell heavily on his right shoulder when attempting to effect a run out a few overs earlier. He returned for the final overs, taking two catches to dismiss Travis Head and Bailey off Pollard.Head earned his selection after Warner was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a broken finger sustained against South Africa on Saturday.

"Rain ensured England and Sri Lanka drew the third Test at Lords on Monday, a result that saw England win the three-match series 2-0.Sri Lanka set 362 to win, finished on 78 for one after rain, which had prevented any play before lunch on the final day, finally saw the umpires abandon the match as a draw at 5:12 pm local time (1612 GMT).Dimuth Karunaratne was 37 not out and Kusal Mendis 17 not out.Mondays result left Sri Lanka still searching for their first Test win at Lords, having now drawn six and lost two of their longest-format clashes at the home of cricket.Only 22 balls were possible between lunch and tea after rain washed out Mondays first session, but that was long enough for Sri Lanka to lose opener Kaushal Silva.Sri Lanka resumed Monday on 32 without loss. Karunaratne was 19 not out and Silva unbeaten on 12.Mondays first over saw Silva edge Broad just short of England captain Alastair Cook at first slip. But Anderson, Englands all-time leading Test-wicket taker, struck when Silva, padding up after failing to pick an inswinger going against the Lords slipe, was lbw for 16.Silva reviewed but to no avail, with Sri Lanka 45 for one. No sooner had Silva been dismissed than the umpires took the players off the field after just 18 minutes play. But the weather relented for play to resume after tea. Even though the floodlights were on, there was now a risk the match might be halted for bad light.Bairstows Test-best 167 not out and 85 from Cook were the major contributions to Englands first innings 416. Sri Lanka could only manage 288 in reply, despite fifties from Karunaratne and Silva.Englands second innings 233 for seven declared saw Alex Hales again fall short of a maiden Test century with 94 -- his third fifty of a series where the opener had twice been dismissed in the 80s.Sri Lanka continue their tour with two one-day internationals against Ireland in Dublin on Thursday and Saturday. They then face England in the first at Nottinghams Trent Bridge in the first of five one-dayers on June 21.Mondays draw meant England lead the inaugural Super Series against Sri Lanka by 10 points to two. But with two points on offer for a win in each of the six white-ball fixtures -- five ODIs and a lone Twenty20 -- Sri Lanka can still win the multi-format Super Series.",sports

"Adam Szalai and Zoltan Stieber scored second-half goals as Hungary stunned highly-fancied Austria 2-0 in their Group F opener in Bordeaux on Tuesday (Jun 14).Austria, tipped as tournament dark horses, dominated the opening period but Szalai fired Hungary ahead on 62 minutes with Stieber wrapping up a shock victory over their old rivals late on in the 138th meeting between the sides.Aleksandar Dragovic was sent off for Austria shortly after Szalai ended an 18-month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup.Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40-year-old to feature at the European Championship, surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history.Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line-up.However, they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left-footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post.The versatile Alaba, operating in his customary central midfield with Austria, soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first-time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic.Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free-kick in a rare opening for Hungary, while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic.Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten, but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post.Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes, though, as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right-hand side of the penalty area.Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period, his stinging 30-yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner.And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai, who was played onside by Fuchs, with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014.Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area, but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking.And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as Hungary completed a stunning upset for their first European Championship win since 1964.",sports

"Marseille: Antoine Griezmann struck late on before Dimitri Payet added a second in injury time as hosts France secured their ticket to the last 16 of Euro 2016 with a 2-0 win over Albania on Wednesday.France began their bid for a first European Championship title in 16 years with a nervous 2-1 win over Romania last Friday.But despite creating a host of scoring chances against the Balkan minnows in a stirring second half, it took Atletico Madrid striker Griezmann to rescue a pale version of Les Bleus with a 90th-minute header at the Stade Velodrome.Coach Didier Deschamps replaced under-performing midfielder Paul Pogba with Anthony Martial while Kingsley Coman replaced Griezmann for Frances first game at the Stade Velodrome since their triumphant World Cup campaign in 1998.It meant a change from a 4-3-3 to a 4-2-3-1, with Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud playing solo up front.But after a frustrating first half of few real chances for the hosts, Deschamps was quickly reconsidering his options.Albania, missing captain and ex-Marseille player Lorik Cana through suspension following his sending-off in the tournament debutants 1-0 defeat to Switzerland, deployed a defence-minded 4-5-1 that made their conservative tactics clear.And France, despite showing plenty of promise throughout, struggled to come up with the antidote.Payet, who hit a stunning winner for France last Friday, showed promise with a great delivery for Giroud but the strikers header was a yard over.Albania midfielder Ermir Lenjanis then sent a drive just wide but the Balkan minnows would threaten again.Frances offside trap was non-existent when Napoli defender Elseid Hysaj broke free on the right to collect a long ball and deliver a cross that deflected off Martial as Armando Sadiku ran in towards goal.It was a brief scare, and France responded with a string of mistakes that left Deschamps holding his head in his hands before the half hour.As widely expected, Pogba replaced Martial for the start of the second half, inspiring the hosts to a far improved performance.Seconds after kick off a great delivery from Giroud was helped on by Blaise Matuidi, but Comans header from six yards out bounced just wide.But France were given another scare when Bacary Sagna missed a dangerous delivery that came off the post, bounced off the head of Ledian Memushaj and went out for a goal kick.This time, the scare was big enough to prompt a rousing French response.Moments later, Payet met Girouds nice lay-off to hit an inviting delivery with the outside of his right boot towards the back post where Pogba rushed in only to fire inches over.When NGolo Kante made a timely interception to help set up Coman on the left, Giroud timed his jump to perfection but his header glanced wide on 67 minutes.Coman was replaced by Griezmann soon after, and moments later Giroud rose to meet Patrice Evras delicately chipped delivery to fire his header off the post.Deschamps replaced Giroud with former Marseille favourite Andre-Pierre Gignac with 13 minutes remaining, but as the hosts maintained their push for the opener it was Griezmann who broke the deadlock when he rose to meet Adil Ramis cross to beat Lazio keeper Etrit Berisha.It broke Albanias resolve and five minutes later Payet claimed his second of the competition with a fine curling strike that beat Berisha at his far post.",sports

"KUWAIT CITY: From Dubai to Tunis, Euro 2016 football fever is sweeping the Arab world, filling cafes and restaurants and overshadowing the nightly television soap operas that normally dominate Ramazan viewing.Every year, during the Muslim fasting month, television audiences soar as families gather in front of their sets after breaking the daytime fast.Usually the ratings are dominated by the dozens of rival soaps that are aired by state and private channels. But this year, Ramazan coincides with the Euros which are another massive draw.Cafes in the Egyptian capital have draped the flags of competing countries over their entrances to attract fans. Some games are played during the day, when devout Muslims are fasting, while others clash with the iftar meal which breaks the daily fast at sunset.In Tunisia, where most cafes are closed during daylight hours in Ramazan, the venue moves to peoples homes. Evening games begin a few minutes after Muslims break their fast, a time most Tunisians spend with their families watching television.Television viewing in the region peaks during Ramazan with ratings remaining high well into the night and advertisers devote large chunks of their budget to the small screens high season.With most games showing on foreign satellite channels, the main Tunisian channels have scheduled daily analysis programmes on the matches.Ramazan hasnt stopped people following the contest on big screens in the Gulf.In Kuwait, whose national team was banned by FIFA in October from taking part in World Cup qualifying matches because of alleged government interference in sports, fans take consolation in the Euros.Germany, the reigning world champions, are the most supported team in Kuwait and in many other Arab countries, exceeding defending European champions.In Dubai, one restaurant has erected a huge tent on the beach with big screens to show the games.",sports

Beth Langston, the seamer, has been ruled out of selection because of an ankle injury.""Monday is going to be a very proud day for our new captain and vice-captain, Heather Knight and Anya Shrubsole,"" Mark Robinson, the head coach, said. ""Under their leadership we will start a new chapter for the England Women's team against a Pakistan side that cannot be underestimated. Pakistan showed everyone during the ICC World T20 how dangerous they can be, when they beat the hosts India on their own patch. They represent a fresh challenge that as a squad we can't wait to get out there and tackle.""All three ODIs of the series will count towards the ICC Women's Championship that will determine the top four direct qualifiers for the 2017 Women's World Cup to be held in England next year. England and Pakistan are currently placed sixth and seventh, respectively. However, England have an incentive of moving to No. 3 if they win the series, while Pakistan can jump two spots should they win all three matches.""Historically, we have a strong record against Pakistan, but the quality of international women's cricket is rising all the time, so we are looking forward to the challenge of facing them on home soil over the next few weeks,"" Robinson said. ""We have a bit of catching up to do in the ICC Women's Championship, so we will need to play some strong, positive cricket to secure maximum points in the three ODIs in order to move into the top four of that table.""",sports
