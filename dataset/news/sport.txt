Australia look set to field two specialist spinners at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  for the first time in a decade when they host West Indies in a dead rubber New Years test starting this weekend An inexperienced and demoralised West Indies touring party succumbed by an innings and 212 runs in Hobart and 177 runs in Melbourne to hand their hosts an unassailable 2 0 lead in the three match series That position  and the likelihood of a turning wicket at the SCG  have encouraged Australia to test out the twin spin option of Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe ahead of their tour of Sri Lanka later this year That the hosts can afford to put out an experimental side in one of the more venerable fixtures in the Australian sporting calendar is not to say there will be nothing at stake when the match gets underway on Sunday  1030 GMT  For West Indies there is pride and a chance to show more of the fighting spirit that stalled Australias victory match in the Boxing Day test in Melbourne last weekend A 3 0 sweep  meanwhile  would send Australia above India to second in the test rankings and they would return to the summit if England can maintain a winning start and beat South Africa in their ongoing four match series Off spinner Lyon is one of the first names on the Australian team sheet these days and he looks like being joined by left arm finger spinner OKeefe in the Australian line up That was made all the more likely when seamer Peter Siddle failed to train on Friday because of an ankle injury  leaving his place in the team in jeopardy OKeefes inclusion for his second test    his first on home soil    would make it the first time Australia have played twin spinners at the SCG since Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill took on South Africa at the ground in 2006 Josh Hazlewood is likely to back up for a sixth straight test alongside James Pattinson in the pace attack with all rounder Mitchell Marsh offering support with his quickening medium pace deliveries after taking 4 61 in Melbourne While Darren Bravo  Denesh Ramdin and skipper Jason Holder showed some resistance with the bat in Melbourne  the paucity of the West Indies bowling is starkly illustrated by the fact that they have taken just 10 wickets over the first two tests Given how little pressure their pace attack have managed to exert on Australia so far in the series  West Indies might consider their own twin spin attack by bringing in leg spinner Devendra Bishoo alongside left arm orthodox Jomel Warrican 
After picking up pretty much every individual honour on offer in a spectacular 2015  Australia captain Steve Smith has a more collective goal in his sights this year    restoring his country to the top of the test rankings Smith finished his annus mirabilis as the worlds top ranked test batsman and won the ICC Cricketer and Test Cricketer of the Year awards as well as the Allan Border Medal as Australias best player The 26 year old scored a remarkable 2 369 runs across all three formats  rattling up 1 474 in tests alone at an average of 73 70 with six centuries He was Australias highest run scorer as they secured a fifth 50 over World Cup triumph and he led the test side to series victories over India  New Zealand and West Indies Even in the Ashes defeat to England  the one major blot on Australias copy book for the year  he scored his maiden double century to claim the Man of the Match award at Lords Even before he was captain  though  Smith was always clear that team success came first With Australia already 2 0 up in the three match series  this weeks third test against West Indies might be a dead rubber but victory would send them above India into second place in the test rankings behind South Africa  Its a huge motivation  thats what we want to be  number one in all formats and were working extremely hard to get there   Smith told reporters on the eve of the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground  SCG  on Saturday  It would be nice to win this week and wrap this series up 3 0  Its been a good summer for us so far  so wed like to finish on a high  Defeat for South Africa in their ongoing series against England would then send Australia back to the summit but even if the English fail to build on their winning start  Februarys two test tour of New Zealand offers Smiths side another chance Australia beat the Black Caps 2 0 on home soil in November but the series was closer than the scoreline would suggest and Smiths side  like many of the top test teams  have struggled to win series overseas in recent years  Playing away from home is a challenge for all teams around the world at the moment  I think thats one of the big things were going to be judged on   Smith added  Its going to be a big challenge in New Zealand  but Im confident if we can continue playing the way we are  hopefully we can have a lot of success over there  Smiths own form hit a minor blip when he was dismissed for 10 in Australias only innings in the first test against West Indies but the runs were flowing again in Melbourne last week after knocks of 134 and 70 without being dismissed  I felt pretty good last week  I guess it was good just to spend a little bit of time in the middle again   Smith said  All of my movement and my swing and everything was back in synch I went back and looked at some footage before the Melbourne test and felt my bat face was a little bit closed  Last week I got my bat face back where I wanted it to be and everything felt really good  so hopefully I can score a few more this week 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum on Sunday said tainted bowler Mohammad Amir should be given the benefit of the doubt and allowed to play for Pakistan in limited overs matches in New Zealand this month Amir has been named in the Pakistan squad which will play three Twenty20 and as many one day games against New Zealand over the next three weeks but his participation depends on New Zealand immigration officials allowing him a visa The fast bowler was only 18 when he handed a five year ban from cricket in 2011 for his involvement in spot fixing He also served three months of a six month prison term His ban  imposed by the International Cricket Council  ICC   has now ended and McCullum said today he should be allowed to resume his career He was a very young man at the time and he's gone through a sound rehabilitation program  McCullum said If he gets out on the field against us  then you play against the man you're playing against  not a man who may have made some mistakes as a youngster  added the explosive batsman New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White also supported Amir's inclusion in the Pakistan squad but stressed that was a personal view and not that of his organisation He was a very  very young man  a boy really  when he was suspended   White said He showed remorse at the time  admitted to it  He's gone through all the rehabilitation and education as prescribed by the ICC I'm personally comfortable with him coming to New Zealand and playing  added White New Zealand's immigration department issued a statement before Christmas saying it had not yet received a visa application for Amir and would consider one when it is received A decision is likely next week

Australias spinners Nathan Lyon and Stephen OKeefe took key wickets between rain showers to peg West Indies back to 207 for six at the end of a weather disrupted opening day of the dead rubber third Test on Sunday More than two hours and 45 minutes of play were lost to rain in a stop start day at the Sydney Cricket Ground  where the tourists fell away in the early evening gloom after winning the toss and making a solid start Denesh Ramdin  unbeaten on 23  and Carlos Brathwaite  35 not out  will resume on day two if the forecast heavy rain stays away The hosts had rolled the dice on the twin spin attack at the SCG for the first time in a decade and got their reward when Lyon and OKeefe got plenty of turn off a straw coloured wicket Off spinner Lyon  2 68  produced a stunning delivery that pitched wide and turned in to take the bail off Jermaine Blackwoods off stump for 10 and returned after the second rain break to remove dangerman Kraigg Brathwaite for 85 Left arm orthodox spinner OKeefe  1 42  then pitched in to have West Indies captain Jason Holder caught superbly at short leg by Joe Burns and claim his first test wicket on Australian soil Trailing 2 0 in the three match series after thumping defeats in Hobart and Melbourne  West Indies had started the day by building on their improved batting performance in the second Test After the early loss of opener Shai Hope  nine   Kraigg Brathwaite and Darren Bravo  33  looked in fine nick as they ushered the tourists to lunch at 92 for one Australias bowlers emerged from the break re energised  however  and James Pattinson got the breakthrough when Bravos miscued pull sent the ball flying to Usman Khawaja running in from the deep That broke a 91 run partnership and brought Marlon Samuels to the crease looking to break his run of eight test innings without getting to the 20 run mark He failed in farcical fashion looking for a quick single that always looked like a gamble  left stranded when Kraigg Brathwaite scuttled back to his crease as Peter Nevill broke the stumps After a long glare at his partner  Samuels headed back to the pavilion with four runs to his name and the rest of the players and umpires followed in his wake as heavy rain came down on the ground Kraigg Brathwaite had brought up his eighth test half century just before lunch by clipping all rounder Mitchell Marsh past long leg for two runs off the 78th ball he faced  He fell 15 runs shy off his fifth test century when Lyon got a little bit of extra bounce to a delivery which caught the openers glove and was snaffled up by Steve Smith at slip   Reuters

Back to back one day defeats in Perth and Brisbane have forced India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni to rethink his strategy of opting to bat first against Australia  who have taken a 2 0 lead in the five match series by chasing down 300 plus targets Dhoni won the toss in both matches and after India posted scores of 309 and 308 and watched as the hosts reeled them in with powerful displays at the crease There was also a suggestion of a lack of discipline about Indias bowlers  who leaked 23 wides in the two matches Ahead of Sundays third one dayer  Dhoni wondered if chasing a target was a better option for India  I feel even if we cut down the extras we will have to score more runs   said Dhoni  There are two options  either put pressure on the batsmen and score 330  or chase down the score  give them the batting first We will have a look and decide what suits us the best  While Rohit Sharma burnished his reputation in limited overs cricket with a second successive century in Brisbane  skipper Dhoni said he was seeking even more his batsmen  As a team we have to win  irrespective of which department is not doing well  and for that we have to score 20 30 more runs   he added  That will put a lot of pressure on the batsmen  because the moment you take your guard right from the first ball  on the back of your mind would be we have to get 330 340 odd runs to be on the safer side and that would put a lot of pressure 
KHULNA  Sabbir Rehman gave an account of his all round abilities in Bangladesh's 42 run win over Zimbabwe in the second T20 in Khulna  He smacked an unbeaten 43 before picking up the vital wicket of Hamilton Masakadza  one of his three scalps  as the wind was taken out of the visitors' 168 run chase in the ninth over Soumya Sarkar also made 43  but missed out on a bigger score after he threw his wicket away in the 10th over  Yet  Bangladesh kept hitting the boundaries   they managed 11 fours and eight sixes to equal their own record of most sixes in a T20 innings  Zimbabwe's reply was nearly a mirror image of Bangladesh's first half  until Sabbir came along to seal a victory that gave Bangladesh a 2 0 lead in the four match series Bangladesh started well  but the real push came when Tamim Iqbal hammered Neville Madziva for a four and six in the fifth over  But just as he started to rev up his engine  he also found a top edge that was easily taken by Brian Vitori at fine leg in the sixth over Sarkar also looked authoritative by striking three fours and a six before Tamim fell and he then built the base further with Sabbir  But Sarkar threw it away in the 10th over as Malcolm Waller took an easy catch at deep midwicket to end his promising innings of 43 Zimbabwe were further boosted by the wicket of Mahmudullah  who fell to a superb catch by wicketkeeper Richmond Mutumbami  Then Mushfiqur Rahim batted through the second half of the innings to give Bangladesh a solid total to defend adding 52 for the fourth wicket with Sabbir Sabbir made the most of a reprieve on 7 by Mutumbami as he lined up the straight boundaries well  even as Mushfiqur used the bowler's pace well in his 20 ball 24 before hobbling off the field  Shakib then finished off the innings with a cameo as Bangladesh took 50 off the last five overs Masakadza came out all guns blazing  hitting two fours and two sixes in 2 2 overs  while Vusi Sibanda also soon got into the act  Zimbabwe were reprieved twice in the fourth over bowled by Mashrafe Mortaza  First  the substitute Imrul Kayes dropped Masakadza at cover  before Shuvagata couldn't reach a chance at midwicket But Mashrafe soon had a wicket to show as Sibanda was bowled off the inside edge for 21 off 17  It was then that Sabbir was thrown the ball  and he delivered by having Masakadza caught at long on for a 28 ball 30 that had three fours and two sixes  Sean Williams fell soon after to give Shuvagata his first T20I wicket and leave Zimbabwe needing a further 103 runs from the last ten overs  Sabbir then had the wicket of Mutumbami  who holed out to Sarkar at deep midwicket Malcolm Waller briefly kept Zimbabwe in it by striking a four each in the 13th  14th and 15th over  but an already escalating rate was compounded by Bangladesh's spinners  Waller was eventually dismissed for a 21 ball 29 by Al Amin Hossain in the 16th over Mustafizur Rahman then came to the party to dismiss Madziva and Peter Moor in the 17th over to puncture Zimbabwe  The eighth wicket was fittingly taken by Sabbir  who became the second Bangladesh cricketer to score at least 40 and take two wickets in T20 With a series win out of the equation  Zimbabwe have two more matches to potentially get their combinations right leading to the World T20

Big financial incentives for gamblers  small tournaments of little consequence to top players and the ease of fixing the outcome of a one on one sport have helped turn world tennis into a haven for match fixers  according to experts and industry insiders Tennis was rocked on Monday by allegations that the games authorities have failed to deal with widespread match fixing  just as the Australian Open  the first grand slam tournament of the year  kicked off in Melbourne Multiple sources told Reuters that the revelation was no surprise to those who closely follow the sport  where  out of the spotlight at small tournaments around the world  the temptations are obvious and malfeasance very difficult to prove Dozens of untelevised tournaments are held annually and top players often inexplicably lose to relatively unknown opponents  said Steve Georgakis  a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney  who is researching match fixing in tennis  If you have a look at the big tournaments  the Opens or Olympic Games  youll notice that in a lot of these tournaments the favourite usually wins   he said But at a small tournament the following week  how could anyone prove that a top 50 player didnt lose because they were exhausted or injured  said Georgakis A highly ranked player is almost certain to be the odds on favourite to win in these small tournaments and thus has the greatest opportunity to make money by intentionally losing to an outmatched player  handing a big payoff to those behind the fix  Its a one on one sport and what you do is  youre the favourite and you get a few other people to load up on the other player to win and then you throw the match And you can never get caught   Georgakis added Sports betting has exploded in recent years with the proliferation of online and mobile gambling sites  and could be worth as much as $3 trillion annually  Patrick Jay  an independent betting expert  told the United Nations in 2015 In that sea of money  tennis is the second most active betting market  trailing only soccer  research conducted by the European Gaming and Betting Association shows Betting on tennis is relatively simple and comes with enormous potential payoffs  a professional tennis gambler told Reuters under the condition of anonymity Many bookmakers have created disincentives to bet point by point or game by game with limits on those types of bets  pushing gamblers towards the payoffs for a winning bet on the overall match  Say you want to throw a game but win the match  why would you bother  You can only win a couple of thousand of dollars   the gambler said Bookmakers are obliged to report suspicious betting patterns to the Tennis Integrity Unit  which was set up to police illegal activities in world tennis But a source at a major bookmaker told Reuters under the condition of anonymity that it is ultimately up to the authorities to act  Most money is won by betting on the favourite  which is not a good result for bookmakers   he added  But if hes up one set to love and then  in play  people start betting on the outsiderthat would be us getting on the front foot  most likely  to say  to the authorities  is there anything you need for us to look into    the bookmaker said

Stephen Cook became the 100th batsman to score a debut Test century and his innings of 115 helped South Africa amass 329 for five on the first day of the final Test against England on Friday in their bid to salvage pride in a lost series Hashim Amla scored his 25th Test century as he and Cook shared a second wicket stand of 202 but captain AB de Villiers departed second ball on a day of contrasting fortunes as England  2 0 up in the four Test series  fought back to claim four wickets after tea Temba Bavuma  32  and Quinton de Kock  25  were not out at the close of play at Centurion Park Handed his debut at the age of 33  one of five South Africa changes from the team badly beaten in the third Test in Johannesburg last week  Cook brought his domestic form to the test arena with a dream start to his international career He survived two dropped catches  two close run out calls and an lbw appeal unsuccessfully reviewed by England before reaching three figures    a nervous spell in the 90s exacerbated by the departures of Amla and De Villiers But Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball on his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  looked organised from the start  hitting a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side He should have been out on 47 but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow off Stuart Broads bowling  He was eventually bowled after an innings of 187 balls when he got an inside edge to a delivery from Chris Woakes Amla  who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting  looked effortless as he raced to three figures  scoring 109 off 168 balls with 19 boundaries before he played on to Ben Stokes De Villiers  captain for his second Test  was out for his second duck in successive innings  caught at second slip by Joe Root off Broad Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg dismissed Dean Elgar for 20 for the first wicket of the day as the short leg fielder continued a run of spectacular dismissals in the series JP Duminy was Moeen Alis second wicket  trapped lbw for 16    the last wicket of the day as England checked South Africas progress after they had look poised for a huge total on 237 for one   Reuters 
Hashim Amla scored an unbeaten century and Stephen Cook was 91 not out to lead South Africa to 224 for one at tea on the first day of the final Test against England as the hosts bid to salvage pride in a lost series Amlas 25th Test century came off 131 balls in a confident display which brought him 18 fours while Cook was nine runs short of a debut Test century at Centurion Park on Friday Amla  who gave up the captaincy after the second Test to concentrate on his batting  looked effortless as he raced to three figures to cheers South Africa who lost two of the first three Tests and the series He was 102 not out at the interval Cook  handed his debut at the age of 33 in one of five South Africa changes after defeat in Johannesburg last week  offered a straightforward chance after lunch when he got a healthy edge to a Stuart Broad delivery but was dropped by wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow on 47 There was another more difficult opportunity for Bairstow down the leg side when Cook was on 76  But Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he made his debut for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  looked organised at the crease as he brought to the Test arena his dominant form in domestic competition He hit a four off the first ball of the match when James Andersons delivery strayed down leg side Yet another freakish catch by James Taylor at short leg was the only positive moment of the day for England as Dean Elgar was dismissed for 20 in unusual circumstances before lunch Taylor showed a sharp presence of mind to grasp a catch after Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf  allowing him to snatch it up before it dropped to the ground Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali  hitting with some power  and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review of the television evidence by the third umpire It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor  thriving in the most dangerous position on the field South Africa won the toss and had no hesitation in electing to take first use of a good batting wicket Their advantage was increased by a poor England bowling display with too many balls drifting down the leg side or pitched too short   Reuters 
Dean Elgar fell to a freak catch but debutant Stephen Cook remained unbeaten on 46 to help South Africa reach 107 for one at lunch on the opening day of the fourth and final Test against England at Centurion Park on Friday Hashim Amla was batting on 34 at the break  having added 72 runs with Cook for the flourishing second wicket partnership after Elgar was dismissed for 20 James Taylor  at short leg  showed good anticipation and presence of mind when Elgars stinging shot hit him in the leg and the ball somehow got stuck around his calf  allowing him to pluck it before it could drop on the ground Elgar had danced down to wicket to Moeen Ali and will count himself exceedingly unlucky to have been dismissed after a lengthy review by the television umpire It was the third extraordinary catch in the last two Tests for the diminutive Taylor  thriving in the most dangerous position on the field Cook began his Test career hitting four off the first ball of the game as James Andersons opening delivery strayed down leg side It set the tone for the opening session with England being inconsistent with their bowling line  often drifting down the leg side and erring in length on the short side The 33 year old Cook  whose father Jimmy was dismissed first ball when he debuted for South Africa in 1992 at the age of 39  was one of five changes from the third Test made by the home team South Africa captain AB de Villiers won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket expected to provide for ideal batting on the opening day England  who have taken an unassailable 2 0 lead in the series  made just one change to their team with seamer Chris Woakes  who played in the first Test  coming in for the injured Steven Finn   Reuters

 Mitchell Marsh kept calm after New Zealand got the sniff of an unlikely victory and scored his sixth one day international half century to guide Australia to a four wicket win in the second match of their one day series on Saturday The victory levelled the three match series at 1 1 with the final game in Hamilton on Monday Australia have not lost a bilateral one day series since India in October  2013 Marsh scored an unbeaten 69 and combined with John Hastings  48 not out  in an unbroken 86 run seventh wicket partnership for the visitors as they overhauled New Zealands 281 for nine with 3 3 overs remaining David Warner top scored with 98 in Australias 283 6  and combined with the recalled Usman Khawaja  50  in a 122 run opening stand that had set the foundation for their victory Mitchell Santner had almost taken the game away from the visitors with his left arm spin  breaking the opening partnership and then trapping Warner leg before when the aggressive opener was within sight of his sixth one day century Santner then had Matthew Wade brilliantly caught in the deep by Adam Milne for two to reduce the visitors to 197 for six in the 33rd over and give the hosts a sniff of victory in a game they had not played well enough to win Too many overs were peppered with boundary balls as they struggled with their length on a wicket that had little help for the bowlers They had also not posted a big enough target as their innings suffered from fits and starts with all of the batsmen  apart from Henry Nicholls  laying solid foundations only to fall when they needed to build Kane Williamson top scored with 60  though the hosts total was only pushed to a score considered defendable courtesy of a 61 run eighth wicket stand between Santner  45 not out  and Milne  36  The 24 year old Santner  who only made his international debut last year  is quickly impressing as an automatic selection in all formats of the game with his fluid batting and handy left arm spin   Reuters   Saturdays match showcased his blossoming capabilities  with New Zealand slumping to 193 for six in the 37th over and in danger of being bowled out before their full allocation Santner  who was joined by the right handed Milne 12 runs later  however kept the strike ticking over to put the bowlers off their rhythm  turned singles into twos with hard running and hit the bad ball to the boundary Opening bowler Josh Hazlewood  however  ended the partnership  and stopped New Zealand from edging closer to a more competitive 300  to finish with 3 61 from 10 overs 
 New Zealand tallied 281 for 9 in Wellington despite a much improved Australian bowling and fielding effort in a match the visitors must win to keep the Chappell Hadlee series alive Kane Williamson made a smooth 60 but it was a late innings partnership of 61 from 44 balls between Mitchell Santner and Adam Milne that added heft to the innings after the Australians had claimed regular wickets throughout the afternoon Legspinner Adam Zampa bowled well in his first international match to claim the wickets of Williamson and Grant Elliott  while John Hastings  Josh Hazlewood  Scott Boland and Mitchell Marsh also put in decent shifts with the ball Nevertheless  Australia must perform far more staunchly with the bat than they managed in the series opener at Eden Park if they wish to force a decider at Seddon Park in Hamilton in two days' time  Usman Khawaja  among others  will be eager to make a difference Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding in Auckland  dropping Shaun Marsh for Khawaja  while Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to back soreness  and the debutant Zampa was called up in place of the injured James Faulkner  Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border New Zealand  by contrast  were unchanged  in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007  Their captain Brendon McCullum led a typically hyperactive start to proceedings  clattering 28 from 12 balls including a six off each of the Australia pacemen Boland's very first ball was sent flying back over his head and into the sight screen  but he responded well by pulling back his length and being rewarded when McCullum charged again and was bowled  That wicket scotched much of the early momentum  even if Martin Guptill and Williamson moved along smoothly enough for the next 11 overs It was Mitchell Marsh who broke the stand  prompting a miscue from Guptill when he tried to force the pace a little more  The chance swirled out towards deep cover  where Khawaja showed excellent judgment to claim a catch more difficult than it appeared  Marsh had another victim when Henry Nicholls  called up to the Test team this week  wafted at a wide delivery  New Zealand had stalled Williamson and Elliott formed another useful stand without ever looking in total command  This was in part due to the thoughtful work of Zampa  who varied his pace artfully to keep the batsmen guessing  His reward would come in consecutive overs  as first Williamson then Elliott pushed catches to cover as they tried to manufacture boundaries That put New Zealand five down  and regular wickets from there prevented the hosts from pulling together a total of the dimensions they managed at Eden Park  Santner and Milne pulled back some of the ground in the closing overs  but the tourists could be happier with their effort 
 New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum won the toss and chose to bat first against Australia in the second Chappell Hadlee ODI at Westpac Stadium in Wellington Australia made three changes to the team that was given a hiding at Eden Park  dropping Shaun Marsh for Usman Khawaja  while Scott Boland came in for Kane Richardson due to some back soreness  and the debutant Adam Zampa came into the side in place of the injured James Faulkner  Zampa had his ODI cap presented to him by Allan Border New Zealand  by contrast  were unchanged  in a match where they can complete a series victory over Australia for the first time since 2007 The pitch is firm and the weather is pleasant  with plenty of runs in prospect for the afternoon Teams New Zealand  Martin Guptill  Brendon McCullum  captain   Kane Williamson  Henry Nicholls  Grant Elliott  Corey Anderson  Luke Ronchi  wk   Mitchell Santner  Adam Milne  Matt Henry  Trent Boult Australia  Usman Khawaja  David Warner  Steven Smith  captain   George Bailey  Glenn Maxwell  Mitchell Marsh  Matthew Wade  wk   John Hastings  Adam Zampa  Scott Boland  Josh Hazlewood 
A skilful performance from the left arm duo of Mohammad Asghar and Wahab Riaz sealed Peshawar Zalmi's 24 run win in their opening fixture against Islamad United Defending 145  Asghar's slow  loopy spinners derailed Islamabad's top order  He dismissed Babar Azam for a duck in his first over  Umar Amin for four in his second and then got the big wicket of Misbah ul Haq for 12 as Islamabad lost half their side for 66 runs  Shane Watson  who made 28  was their top scorer  but he was dismissed by Wahab in the ninth over Sam Billings and Andre Russell resisted  but both of them fell off successive balls and Wahab finished with 3 for 32  Asghar had a hand in those wickets too   he clung on to two sharp chances on the cover boundary and later played them down by saying he had large hands like most Pathans and so it would be hard to drop catches  So United fell to 121 for 9 and their second defeat in as many matches In the first innings  Peshawar managed to reach 145 with Tamim Iqbal making a run a ball half century  It ended up a crucial contribution considering Peshawar  having chosen to bat  had stumbled to 88 for 4 in the 15th over and needed a set batsman in the middle for Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy to go hard at the other end  Their late hitting pushed the total past 140 in the death  though  none of Peshawar's batsmen  barring Tamim  managed a score more than 16  For Islamabad  Russell took 3 for 31 
Darren Sammys brilliant 48 steered Peshawar Zalmi to 135 for seven in 20 overs against Quetta Gladiators in the seventh T20 match of the Pakistan Super League here at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday Sent into bat by Quetta Gladiators captain Sarfraz Ahmed  Zalmis batsmen could not resist against the opponents bowling except Sammy Slow left arm bowler Mohammad Nawaz captured three wickets for 29 and fast medium bowler Umar Gul bagged two for 19 for Quetta Gladiators

</Swing and seam friendly conditions  a lack of truly scary Australian bowlers and New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum's retirement are all themes that will resonate when the first test gets underway in Wellington on Friday The Basin Reserve wicket was heavily grassed just 48 hours out from the toss and  even if brilliant sunshine in New Zealand's capital was expected to brown it off  McCullum and Steve Smith are still likely to ask the opposition to bat Similarly grassed pitches in New Zealand in recent years have not helped the fast bowlers as much as expected  however  as both captains noted on Thursday  I think the wicket will dry out quicker than what you'd expect   McCullum said   The first two days will be challenging for the batsmen      and  you have to just hang in there and get a competitive score  It's not going to be the 500 or 600 but you just have to be competitive and then the third and fourth innings are where things take shape  Despite having won 29 of their 55 previous tests against New Zealand and taken the home encounter 2 0 last November  Australia are not overwhelming favourites to win the series and reclaim the number one ranking in test cricket Their pace bowling unit of Peter Siddle  Jackson Bird and new spearhead Josh Hazlewood lacks the blistering speed of the two Mitchells  Starc and Johnson  both of whom created doubt  and at times fear  in the minds of batsmen Hazlewood's ability to swing the ball and Siddle's to seam it off the pitch should create issues for New Zealand but the Australians have shown they are not immune to struggles with similar movement Last year at Trent Bridge  Stuart Broad showed how badly they play the moving ball when he took 8 15 as England skittled the tourists for 60 in their first innings  We haven't been good enough with the bat on wickets that have been doing a bit in the last year or so   Smith said  The wicket here looks like it might do a bit so we've got a bit to prove and we've got to adapt accordingly  a lot better than we have in recent times  New Zealand's opening duo Tim Southee and Trent Boult have the ability to swing and seam the ball and while they have been down on pace this summer  recent outings have suggested they are pushing it back into the 140kph plus range That pace will be needed to try and put pressure on an Australian side which is likely to retain the aggressive mindset that has characterised their batting in recent years Underpinning the entire series is the fact McCullum will retire after the second test in Christchurch The first match at the Basin Reserve will be his 100th test  all of which have been played in succession since his debut in 2004  I'm looking forward to these two test matches   McCullum said   It will be a great series  two evenly matched teams  Not a better way to go out really

On a dry surface in a dusty Ranchi ground  India's top order moved into customary home form  and their bowlers exposed a fragile Sri Lanka top order  Shikhar Dhawan was bruiser in prime  unleashing an early shellacking that brought him 51  and set the team on course to a big total  They reached 196 for 6  thanks to helpful hands from the top five  which today included a pinch hitting Hardik Pandva  That total was 69 too many for Sri Lanka On a pitch with little pace and minimal seam movement  the pacers that had delivered Sri Lanka's Pune win  were expensive  Even Sri Lanka's first T20 international hat trick   to Thisara Perera   barely made a difference  coming as it did in the penultimate over  Dinesh Chandimal will perhaps rue having chosen to bowl first R Ashwin had troubled Sri Lanka's batsmen even on the Pune green top  and MS Dhoni savvily had him open the bowling here  Ashwin removed a returning Tillakaratne Dilshan second ball  and the chase never really recovered from that  Soon they were 3 for 16  Ashish Nehra claiming two early scalps  Chandimal and Chamara Kapugedara then embarked on a recovery that was far too slow to give the visitors any real chance of victory  and wickets tumbled late in the middle overs  as the required rate crept up through the teens  Ashwin finished with 3 for 14 from his four overs Dhawan got to 50 off his 22nd delivery  but departed soon after  nicking a throat high Dushmantha Chameera ball to the keeper  That wicket bought Sri Lanka brief respite  They bowled five overs for 30  before the runs began to flow again Chameera claimed Rohit's scalp in the 14th over  with an athletic return catch  and Senanayake removed Rahane soon after  but India's final push began when Pandya arrived at the crease a few places higher than he would normally bat  After two sighters he began his assault Raina added his own finishing blows to the closing surge  taking particular liking to Chameera  whose figures he ruined  Having sent down his first two overs for 10 runs  Chameera saw his third disappear for 18  His last also went for 10  In between Perera took a low key hat trick  having Pandya  Raina and Yuvraj Singh hole out to low full tosses  His figures were dramatically improved as a result  He finished with 3 for 33 from three overs Dilshan was stumped over reaching off the first ball he faced  Seekkuge Prasanna was sent up the order to provide some early impetus  but lacked the technique to deal with the new ball  and chewed up four balls for one run  Danushka Gunathilaka amplified Sri Lanka's problems at the top of the order with another poor score Kapugedara and Chandimal's 49 ball fourth wicket partnership yielded only 52 runs  By the time they had departed  off successive Jadeja deliveries in the 12th over  the required rate had climbed to more than 14 5  and the chase was kaput  Dasun Shanaka and Milinda Siriwardana struck some late sixes  doing good to at least their own batting confidence  if nothing much for the team cause

Sarah Taylor scored a third successive half century and became the second player after Charlotte Edwards to score 2000 runs in the format as England sealed the three match series against South Africa 2 1  Taylor anchored a relatively straightforward chase   the first time England have batted second in the series   after captain Edwards opted to bowl first under cloudy skies and England restricted their opposition to 131 for 4 England took advantage of the swing on offer and reduced South Africa to 6 for 3 in the second over before Mignon du Preez and Lizelle Lee built the recovery  They shared an 89 run stand for the fourth wicket to engineer a strong comeback   Lee's unbeaten 69 off 61 balls was a career best   but South Africa's score on a good pitch and a fast outfield  never looked enough South Africa's problems started early when Tash Farrant  the left armer making her first appearance in the series  had Trish Chetty stumped down the leg side off a wide  In the next over  Anya Shrubsole found movement and bowled Dane van Niekerk  who was playing in her 50th T20I  and Marizanne Kapp with successive inswinging deliveries  She was not far away from a hat trick with another full and straight delivery to Lee but a thin inside edge saved the batsman Lee kept her composure and rebuilt steadily with her captain  du Preez  They complemented each other well with Lee the aggressor and du Preez the accumulator  The ninth over was the most profitable with Lee taking 15 runs off Jenny Gunn before offering a chance  Lee was on 30 and hit the last ball of the over to long off but Heather Knight could not hold on South Africa still had work to do at 49 for 3 at the halfway stage  Du Preez shifted gears and helped by some ordinary fielding from England  started to speed up the scoring rate  South Africa managed 26 runs in three overs before Farrant was brought back to quieten things down With not even 100 on the board and only four overs left  South Africa's urgency grew  Du Preez was run out by a direct hit after a trying to steal a second off a Knight fumble and it was up to Lee to finish strongly  She reached 50 off 51 balls immediately after du Preez was dismissed and played a part in South Africa scoring 35 runs off the last three overs  They still ended with the lowest first innings score of the series and would have known it would be tough to defend England were into their task early when Amy Jones climbed into overpitched deliveries from Shabnim Ismail  She scored 14 runs off the first over before Ismail had her caught behind  But  as was the case in Cape Town when South Africa made the early breakthrough  it brought England's best pair together but this time it was not for too long  While Taylor scored freely  Edwards could not get away and gifted deep square leg a catch to give South Africa some hope  although with Taylor at the crease  England could always feel safe Taylor went aerial with confidence and was strong on the drive and cut  With Knight playing a supporting role  England were well on their way  Taylor brought up fifty off 33 balls and thoughb Knight was dismissed off the next ball England needed just 40 off 58 balls South Africa claimed a few consolation wickets   van Niekerk took a stunning one handed return catch in her follow through to dismiss Taylor and Ismail bowled Nat Sciver and Danielle Wyatt with full deliveries in the same over   but England reached the target with 4 3 overs to spare  Tammy Beaumont  who had been moved down from opening to the middle  played confidently to finish unbeaten on 21

CHRISTCHURCH  Joe Burns and Usman Khawaja reduced Australias victory target to 131 runs with nine wickets in hand at the end of the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Hagley Oval on Tuesday Burns was on 27  while Khawaja was 19 not out with Australia 70 for one after being set 201 runs to win the match and series 2 0 They had earlier dismissed the hosts in their second innings for 335 after tea David Warner was the only wicket to fall when he was caught down the leg side by BJ Watling from Neil Wagner for 22  though New Zealand needed to ask for a review to determine the ball had glanced his gloves Jackson Bird grabbed his first five wicket haul to help wrap up New Zealands second innings after tea that had been characterised by stubborn middle and lower order resistance Bird  who had grabbed three quick wickets after lunch  including the key scalp of Kane Williamson  97   bowled Matt Henry for 66    his first half century and highest score    then had Trent Boult caught for a duck to finish with 5 59 James Pattinson finished with 4 77  but had the most important wicket in the final session on Tuesday when he dismissed Watling for 46 after the wicketkeeper had combined with Henry in a crucial 118 run partnership Until their eighth wicket stand  the hosts had been in danger of being dismissed with a lead of only about 100 after Bird had broken a 102 run partnership between Williamson and Corey Anderson  40  that had got their side into credit The pair batted through a heated first session in which Australia dropped two catches  had two reviews turned down and an lbw decision overturned The second review  just before lunch and against Williamson  prompted a petulant outburst from captain Steve Smith and Josh Hazlewood  with the tall fast bowler likely to face further sanctions after microphones picked up his expletive laden rant New Zealand had begun the day on 121 for four  14 runs in arrears of Australias 505  but their stubborn resistance ensured the match would enter a fifth and final day The target also appeared competitive though not overly challenging on a good batting surface and Australia should seal victory to reclaim the number one ranking in Test cricket  though Anderson said his side would make it tough for the visitors   Reuters

Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini  once the two most powerful men in world football  had their bans for ethics violations upheld on Wednesday  although they were reduced from eight years to six The 79 year old Blatter  who served for 17 years as FIFA president  and Platini  60  one of the greatest players of all time and UEFA president since 2007  had appealed against the bans imposed last October The ruling came two days before FIFA holds a special elective Congress to appoint a successor to Blatter  who was President of the ruling body from 1998 before standing down four days after winning his final term of office last May Neither man will be at Friday's Congress following the decision and Platini could hardly contain his wrath  The decision is insulting  shameful and is a violation of rights   he said in a statement  The charges against me are baseless  built from the ground up and surreal in view of the facts and the explanations I gave during the hearing  I will go to the end of my fight to show that Im innocent  to restore my rights and identify who is responsible for this plot  There was no immediate response from Blatter DARK NIGHTThe pair will now turn to the Court of Arbitration for Sport  CAS  for the last chance to restore their reputations and roles in the game The final verdict from FIFA's headquarters  though  came on a rainy evening in Zurich The statement issued by the Appeal Panel  while upholding the ban  did determine that  some strong mitigating factors for Mr Platini and Mr Blatter were not taken into account when establishing the sanction  One of the factors for reducing the ban was the pair's lifetime service to football Blatter and Platini were banned over a payment of 2 million Swiss francs  $2 03 million  made to the Frenchman in 2011 by FIFA with Blatter's approval for work done a decade earlier They said the payment honoured a verbal or gentleman's agreement made in 1998 for work carried out by the Frenchman when he was a technical adviser to Blatter SUSPENSION IMPOSEDThe decision not to overturn the bans followed the 12 year suspension imposed on Jerome Valcke  who was sacked as FIFA's secretary general last month Valcke  the man responsible for running FIFA's day to day administration  was found guilty of misconduct over the sale of World Cup tickets  abuse of travel expenses  attempting to sell TV rights below their market value and destruction of evidence Platini was European Footballer of the Year three times while Blatter worked at FIFA for 41 years after originally joining as Technical Director in 1975  He served as Secretary General from 1981 until he succeeded Joao Havelange as president in 1998 Blatter's reign was mired in controversy and the announcement that he was resigning came in June  less than a week after American and Swiss authorities arrested FIFA and other officials at a Zurich hotel on corruption charges  two days before the Congress and election took place Platini was  for many years  regarded as Blatter's natural successor and they worked harmoniously before rifts occurred in their relationship Platini was openly critical of Blatter in the run up to last year's election  but both have been united again in being brought down by the scandal that has rocked their sport

World crickets most intriguing rivalry will once again be renewed when India take on an unpredictable Pakistan with rehabilitated pacer Mohammed Amir being the focus of attention in a roundrobin league encounter of the Asia Cup T20 tournament here today  Saturday  The match will also serve as a precursor to the two teams opening round battle in the ICC World Twenty20 next month The IndoPak cricket contests over the years have carried a legacy not to forget the political undercurrents involved whenever the two bitter neighbours square off on the 22 yards But the most exciting aspect will be whether the tainted Amir gets to play in the XI Back after serving a fiveyear ban for spotfixing Amir has started playing for the national team since the tour of New Zealand and this immensely talented bowler will certainly come out all guns blazing against the Indian batsmen Virat Kohli has already welcomed Amir s return but not much is known as to what other Indian players including skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni think about the convicted spot fixer s inclusion In India  the BCCI has taken a zero tolerance approach imposing life bans on players like S Sreesanth  Ankeet Chavan  Ajit Chandila who have no hopes of returning to competitive cricket For Amir  though a good performance against India will probably help him gain some credibility not only in the dressing room but also among the common cricketloving public in Pakistan In terms of preparation  both teams have been suitably prepared considering the amount of Twenty20 cricket they have played in the past one month India already kicked off their World T20 preparations in style having won six out of the seven games played so far Pakistan cricketers on the other hand are coming straight after playing in the Pakistan Super League  PSL  which keeps them well prepared Traditionally  India have never ever lost to Pakistan in the global events but it has not been the case in the continental event where Shahid Afridi and co have performed well However the Asia Cup has never been played in the T20 format which is also a first   Online 
India and Pakistan will lock horns in the highly anticipated Asia Cup on Saturday at the Shere Bangla National stadium in Mirpur India are hot favourites during the mouth watering encounter  But in T20 format its very difficult to predict a winner Pakistani all rounder Shoaib Malik said that though India have the winning momentum  Pakistan could give a tough fight to their old rivals Indian batsmen are very consistent but we have a good bowling attack  This is going to be a great game  This is going to be a big opportunity for players of both the teams  Malik told a leading Hindi news channel Malik  however  made it clear that his wife Sania Mirza would cheer for Team India this weekend We maintain the same status  She supports Team India and wants her husband to do well  perform well in the middle if he is playing  he added

The World Twenty20 has provided a stage for Asian sides to flourish in its short history and host India's scintillating form leading up to the tournament will only fuel local hopes that the trend will continue India  Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won three out of the five stagings of the biennial tournament  while the 2010 final was the only one that did not feature a team from South Asia Former players and pundits have been united in endorsing India  who won the 50 over World Cup at home in 2011  as favourites to add a second World Twenty20 title to their cabinet and given the side's run of form  it is hardly surprising Mahendra Singh Dhoni's men have won 10 of the 11 Twenty20 contests they have played this year  including a 3 0 win in Australia  and have looked supremely balanced with their often soft bowling attack also showing plenty of bite The only worry for India's fanatical cricket following will be that the team have peaked too early and they will be desperately hoping that the law of averages catches up with them after the final at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on April 3 While India have enjoyed a relatively trouble free build up to the tournament  it has been far from smooth sailing for fellow Asian contenders Pakistan and Sri Lanka Pakistan  the 2009 champions  arguably have the most potent pace attack with left arm fast bowler Mohammad Amir seamlessly integrating into the side after a five year spot fixing ban But Shahid Afridi's men have had troubles with their top order  prompting the selectors to twice tinker with the squad and a row over security leading to a venue change for the highly charged India match will not have helped matters Defending champions Sri Lanka have failed to adequately replace retired batting stalwarts Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene after their 2014 World Twenty20 triumph and were forced to install Angelo Mathews as their new captain this week The island nation have lost recent series against New Zealand  India and a woeful Asia Cup display led to the sacking of the entire selection panel The team and their supporters will keep their fingers crossed on the fitness of pace spearhead Lasith Malinga  who relinquished the captaincy due to the slow recovery of his injured knee but insists he can still play a part AUSTRALIA'S T20 CONUNDRUMAustralia will look to end their lack of success in the format and add the T20 title to their 50 over World Cup triumph on home soil last year  banking on their explosive batting line up to make up for the lack of a potent spinner They have not left anything to chance though  replacing Aaron Finch with test and one day international skipper Steve Smith to lead the side  who have had a number of players plying their trade in the Indian Premier League  IPL  over the years Another side hoping the experience of playing in the IPL will come in handy for their players will be South Africa  who once again will be determined to shed their 'chokers' tag at another global championship AB de Villiers  believed by most to be the most destructive batsman in world cricket  has often entertained crowds in India during the IPL with his 360 degree batting and South Africa will hope the 32 year old can end their wait for a World Cup title FEARLESS ENGLANDJos Buttler  Alex Hales and Eoin Morgan will believe they can be match de Villiers' pyrotechnics for England but the 2010 champions' bowling attack appears short of experience They also have a powerful striker in Ben Stokes and the dependable Joe Root with the willow but it is to be seen if the batting can gloss over their bowling shortcomings Fellow contenders New Zealand may have a few psychological issues to resolve if they are to overcome their tendency to come up short on the big stage Their preparations have been overshadowed by the recent death of former captain Martin Crowe while the retirement of Brendon McCullum has robbed them of an exceptional reader of the game with unbridled batting firepower Darren Sammy will also have to inspire an understrength West Indies team  who just weeks ago were planning to boycott the tournament over a contractual dispute  if the 2012 champions are to stand any chance of winning a second title

New Zealand are bracing for a trial by spin when they open their World Twenty20 campaign against hosts India on Tuesday  skipper Kane Williamson said on the eve of their Super 10 fixture The Indian team have been widely touted as firm favourites to win the biennial event due to their knowledge about the conditions at home and a strong run of form in the buildup to the tournament New Zealand  though  have defeated India in all their previous four meetings in the shortest format of the game but their progress was somewhat thwarted against England's spinners on Saturday in their warm up match  We certainly are expecting spin to pay a big part in this tournament   Williamson told reporters on Monday  adding their past record against India would have no bearing on the match  I suppose judging by the warm up games in Mumbai  they had a bit for the seamers and it swung a little bit  They were very good surfaces but from what cricket we have seen here in Nagpur  spin looks likely to play a big part  It's important that we adjust our gameplan accordingly  Off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin will lead India's slow bowling attack along with Ravindra Jadeja while part timer Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina are also expected to chip in New Zealand arrived at the tournament after a preparatory camp in Dubai  having played a two test home series against Australia  during which former captain Brendon McCullum retired from international cricket Williamson was confident there would not be any problems making the switch to the 20 over format  We go into the match tomorrow with a clean slate  India is a strong side and Twenty20 cricket is fickle in nature   Williamson said India  who won the 50 over World Cup at home in 2011  defeated Australia and Sri Lanka in bilateral series before winning the Asia Cup in Bangladesh  a run that saw them win 10 of their last 11 T20 matches Batting stalwart Virat Kohli was confident the team can handle the burden of expectations  At home we expect that  we're prepared for that   Kohli said   The skill required is how you manage yourself off the field  because on the field is probably the safest and quietest for you  especially in your home country  The field is where you face the least pressure in big tournaments like this  We're taking some good momentum into the World Cup  The Asia Cup was a good preparation for us  getting a feel of playing against big teams  This is far more challenging  with teams from all over the world

South Africa fast bowler Dale Steyn has sounded a warning to batsmen at the World Twenty20 in India as he prepares to get his sides campaign off to a positive start against England in Mumbai on Friday Steyn recently returned to the South Africa side after an injury plagued season that he says has only increase his resolve to help his side to an elusive major one day trophy Following a 2 0 home Twenty20 series victory over England last month  the South Africans are brimming with confidence I dont want to say that we have the upper hand but we have beaten them  England  in the shorter format and they do know it  Im fit and strong to play  Steyn told reporters in Mumbai on Wednesday Steyn  who returned to action this month against Australia after groin and shoulder problems  has seen an improvement in South Africas limited overs bowling attack which also includes seamers Kagiso Rabada  Kyle Abbott and Chris Morris When I walked into the side for the Australia series I could see the guys were glowing with confidence  Steyn said I was watching guys who normally sit on the side lines like Kyle Abbott landing their yorkers and slower balls It was great to be out of the side because when I walked back in I realised how much I had missed it and how much these guys have grown as a team  even in that two month gap South Africa play their opening two World Twenty20 matches against England and Afghanistan in the seam friendly conditions of the Wankhede Stadium in MumbaiThey then take on West Indies at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur  which produced a rank turner in the game between India and New Zealand on Tuesday Ive always said that I can bowl on any track  Steyn said I prefer the wickets that are slower and turning  The ball stops and makes it tough for batsmen to hit you out of the ground  especially at a ground like Nagpur which is a big ground As a seamer I back myself  I can bowl fast cutters  its difficult to hit the ball out of the ground when its coming at 140 or 145 and is gripping and stopping 
India's cricket team is undoubtedly  indisputably  unarguably  and by a massive distance  better than Pakistan's cricket team  At football It was probably the only definitive bit of knowledge anyone could have gleaned from watching the two teams' training sessions on the eve of their World T20 clash at the Eden Gardens  If Saturday's big match involved goalposts and a large  inflated ball  India would lose no sleep over it It is  instead  a cricket match  And not just any cricket match  It is the cricket match that causes a spike in the frequency of Venkatesh Prasad sightings on Indian television in the days leading up to it  And of Aamer Sohail and Kiran More and Javed Miandad and Ajay Jadeja and Waqar Younis and Joginder Sharma and Misbah ul Haq It is an India Pakistan clash at a World tournament  and it will come with the inevitable trappings  Famous people will sing national anthems  Massive names will be present among the massive numbers in attendance  Sachin Tendulkar will be there  So will Imran Khan  And Sunil Gavaskar  And Wasim Akram  And Kapil Dev  And Inzamam ul Haq In the middle of all this  India and Pakistan  the cricket teams  will try and tune out the constant swirl of India Pakistan R Ashwin reinforced this during his pre match conference on Friday  in a packed and insufficiently air conditioned media room that evoked the pressure cooker clich  This rivalry is huge   he said   It's very hard to put a finger [on it] and say how huge it is  It's probably bigger than the Ashes is  As far as the Indians go and the Pakistanis go  I don't think they watch this as a game of cricket  It's more of a border rivalry  they want to get one up on each other  So there is much more to this game rather than the game itself taking centrestage  As far as people are concerned  they put their emotions into it  For the players it's about trying to keep the emotions aside and playing the game the best we can  It is something India have invariably managed to do against Pakistan at World events  In six World Cup meetings and four in the World T20  they have never lost  It's the sort of record that can put pressure on both sides  but on this occasion India are under more of it  given that they are playing at home  and given that they were beaten soundly by New Zealand in their first game and therefore have to win this one  Over recent years  Pakistan have usually been underdogs going into matches against India  and on this occasion have the cushion of a big win in their opening game against Bangladesh  History can change  too   Waqar Younis  Pakistan's head coach  said   We are confident  a little more this time because [India] can go out of the tournament also  They will be under a lot of pressure  We have to take it positively  We have won the last match  so there are lots of things going in our favour  hopefully  Yes  there is no doubt that our history hasn't been so good but history can always be changed  In all the previous games  the pressure was on Pakistani team  This is the first time that the pressure is more on India   not arising from victory or defeat at the hands of Pakistan but because this is a very big tournament  I have been a cricketer all my years and it is impossible that India won't be feeling the pressure  I am sure they will be feeling the pressure and we are going to take advantage of that  India arrived in Kolkata on Wednesday night  but only had an optional training session   which only Suresh Raina  Ajinkya Rahane and Pawan Negi attended   on Thursday  Their first full session ahead of the match was on its eve  Ashwin said the light schedule was followed to allow the players to relax after the loss to New Zealand  and not put themselves under too much pressure  I think it was more about trying and relaxing   he said   It had nothing to do with who we are playing  what game we are playing and all that  We have been on the road for the last three months and we thought it's time now to sit in the hotel room and revisit what we did in the last game  The best thing that we can do is to think for ourselves than sitting together and practising  What happens after a game like that is we tend to go into nervous practice  try and overdo everything  and eventually end up going into the match a little more tired than we actually should be  That's the idea behind it  India's practice session on Friday reflected this mindset  with the bowlers hardly taxing themselves and only the middle order trio of Yuvraj Singh  MS Dhoni and Hardik Pandya spending any real length of time batting  Pakistan   after their unconvincing footballing warm up   had a more traditional nets session  with the fast bowlers coming off their full run ups and sending down a relatively large quota of deliveries Two training philosophies  neither definitely better or worse than the other  both geared to the same end  to keep minds focused on bat and ball  to tune out the crowds and the last minute venue changes and the razzmatazz of the build up  As Virat Kohli said before the start of the tournament   On the field is the safest and quietest place for you   And until they actually get on the field  the match will live a parallel existence that has little to do with the actual cricket  It might as well be a football game where Mohammad Irfan and a magically young again Venkatesh Prasad are goalkeepers in a penalty shootout 
Australia began their title defence with a six wicket win against South Africa at the VCA Stadium in Nagpur  It was vice captain Alex Blackwell and captain Meg Lanning who led the way to chase down 103 easily in the end  after they were reduced to 9 for 3 in the fourth over South Africa had an excellent launch pad at 69 without loss in 12 overs after opting to bat  Then they fell into a crater courtesy rush of blood  indecision against spin and a number of misguided strokes to huff and puff to 102 for 6  As hard as they tried  defending it was never going to be easy against the masters of the big occasion who are gunning for their fourth successive title Eventually  the batting meltdown played a big part in the result  as Lanning and Blackwell allayed fears with an unbroken 52 run fifth wicket stand off just 38 balls to see Australia home with nine balls to spare South Africa showed they were up for a fight as Dane van Niekerk did the early running by making 45 in a 72 run opening stand with Trisha Chetty  before Australia strangulated them While Ellyse Perry hustled the batsmen with pace  Lauren Cheatle's canny variations resulted in South Africa's middle order having to manufacture strokes that didn't connect  Chetty's scratchy 34 eventually helped them cross the 100 run mark Australia's thoughts of the chase being a walk in the park were firmly put on the backburner  Alyssa Healy walked across to flick  only to find her leg stump flattened to give the fired up Shabnim Ismail an early sniff  Perry bottom edged a cut to the wicketkeeper  while Ellyse Villani chopped on to leave Australia in tatters before they could reach double figures Lanning's illness that kept her off the field for most parts of South Africa's innings meant she could come in either after 30 minutes or the fall of the fifth wicket  But the conclusion of Ismail's opening burst took with it the sting in their attack as Blackwell and Jess Jonassen added 44 for the fourth wicket  When Jonassen stepped out to be stumped  the game was back in the balance as Australia slipped to 53 for 4  needing 50 off 47 balls Lanning struggled to run as she helped herself to three fours to bring the equation down to 23 off the last four overs  Once within striking distance  the feared white ball striker in her surfaced as she hit Ismail for two fierce square cuts  to convert a tricky chase into a cruise

Indian great Sachin Tendulkar remains the gold standard of batting in the post Bradman era but Virat Kohlis latest masterclass in Sundays World Twenty20 shootout against Australia has prompted comparisons with his famous compatriot Not for the first time in the tournament  it took Kohlis masterly knock to get India across the line in a virtual quarter final against the reigning 50 overs world champions Kohli remained unbeaten after a sublime 82  burnishing his reputation as arguably the best chaser in limited overs cricket with a knock that reminded many of Tendulkars 143 against Australia in a 1998 one dayer at Sharjah dubbed  desert storm  Shane Warne was at the receiving end of Tendulkars wrath in that match and 18 years since the contest  the Australian spin great saw Tendulkars shadow in Kohlis latest knock  Great knock by @imVkohli Reminded me of one of your many special innings buddy   Warne tweeted to his great rival Tendulkar after Kohli secured India a place in the semi finals on Sunday Kohli bejewelled his knock with two sixes and nine boundaries and sprinted tirelessly between wickets in a flawless display of limited overs batting under tremendous pressure He middled every ball  timed his shots with surgical precision and found gaps with eerie regularity to stamp his class  Of the modern players  Ive always thought that Brian Lara was the best placer of the ball   former Australia captain Ian Chappell said   I think I have got Brian in second spot now LARAS PRAISEThe West Indian batting great was also bowled by what he saw and requested videos of Kohlis early days  hailing the Indian as the  best timer of a cricket ball  that he has seen At 27  Kohli stands on the brink of batting greatness with 36 international centuries against his name and averages of 44 in tests  51 in one dayers and 55 in Twenty20 matches It has been a fascinating transformation of a Delhi cricketer perceived initially as yet another brash brat from the streets of a city long accused of inculcating aggression in its youth Since Kohlis international debut in a one dayer against Sri Lanka eight years ago  Mahendra Singh Dhoni has closely watched the tattoo wearing  blunt speaking  heart on his sleeve youngster transform into a mature match winner Kohli hates the idea of an on field confrontations that doesnt include him and Dhoni argued it suits the player who succeeded him as Indias test captain  He will always be the same   Dhoni said after the victory in Mohali   He will be an aggressive character who will be ready to take on challenges and he will be aggressive on the field  But he will also improve  He is shifting in the right direction but he is a tremendous character  He should not lose his character because thats what his strength is

England skipper Eoin Morgan would like to believe his team peaked at the right time at the ongoing World Twenty20 while New Zealand were slightly premature going into Wednesdays semi final at the Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium Kane Williamson and his Kiwi team mates have not put a foot wrong since landing in India  winning all four group matches without really breaking a sweat to qualify for the semi finals as the tournaments only unbeaten team For a side boasting an explosive batting order and a balanced attack to go with  Englands passage proved bumpier Even before they could soak in the atmosphere  England were blown away by a Chris Gayle century in their tournament opener against West Indies in Mumbai Joe Root sparked their recovery in the 230 run chase against South Africa but the narrow victory against Afghanistans modest resources exposed their frailties against spin bowling They looked a significantly better side  however  in Saturdays 10 run win against champions Sri Lanka Jos Buttler underlined his limited overs worth with a belligerent fifty  the pacemen made regular inroads  Ben Stokes delivered a tidy final over and the team held their nerve to secure a victory that seemed to tick most of the boxes  In these tight tournaments you cant get through to the semis unless you are playing good cricket  and thats what we set out to do to give ourselves a chance   coach Trevor Bayliss said  But its about peaking at the right time I wouldnt say weve played the perfect game yet    coaches are always looking for that absolutely perfect game  I dont think its ever been played    but its what any team is striving to do  Having played their last two games at Kotla  England would also hope to cash in on their familiarity with the venue in contrast to their opponents who were on a mini tour of India playing each of their four group games at different venues KIWI ADAPTABILITYThe trouble for England  however  is that New Zealand won all of them as the team  finalists in last years 50 over World Cup  strive to shed the tag of being crickets perennial bridesmaid Leading from the front  Williamson has also displayed the tactical flexibility needed to win a tournament like this New Zealand sprang a surprise in their tournament opener  picking three spinners in a gutsy gamble and went on to beat India  renowned for their batsmens comfort against the turning ball  in their own game Williamson repeated the ploy against Bangladesh in their final group match for a similar result  his immaculate pitch assessment in stark contrast to most of the visiting captains who struggled to read the track as if it was in Braille Left arm spinner Mitchell Santner and leg spinner Ish Sodhi have already forged a formidable partnership for the Kiwis  claiming 17 wickets between them in four matches And if Williamson has noticed Englands struggle against Afghanistans slow bowlers  the Kiwi captain will be tempted to harness Nathan McCullums control and accuracy in a three pronged spin attack As demonstrated by Martin Guptill  the Kiwi batting does not lack firepower but what was more heart warming for the fans is how batsmen like Colin Munro have tempered strokes according to situations  It hasnt been the wham  bam   sort of way that T20 cricket has been   batting coach Craig McMillan said after the victory against Bangladesh in their last group match  They have had to assess it   and have done a really good job of putting the runs on the board to give the bowlers something to work with

The second World Twenty20 semi final is likely to hinge on who emerges on top in the battle between the big hitting West Indian batsmen and Indias wily spinners when the former champions clash at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday India  the worlds top ranked side in the shortest format  arrived at the sixth edition of the tournament with 10 wins from 11 matches in 2016 and were considered overwhelming favourites by fans  opposing captains and bookmakers alike But while an opening Super 10 stage defeat to New Zealand  who reached the semi finals unbeaten  was a wake up call  the home sides credentials came into question in a one run win over Bangladesh  who lost three wickets in the last three balls Virat Kohlis wide blade was then called on to see off a stiff challenge from 50 over world champions Australia in a winner takes all contest to reach the last four  his masterclass glossing over some major batting flaws for the 2007 champions Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma have failed to build a solid foundation for the hosts and their opening stands of five  14  42 and 23 have put pressure on the middle and lower order to provide a bulk of the scoring Left hander Suresh Rainas scores of one  zero  30 and 10 have not been overly helpful either  and calls for the number four batsmans omission from the team have only gained momentum Yuvraj Singhs ankle injury in the win over Australia could open the door for Ajinkya Rahane to play at his home ground in Mumbai but the right hander may be a little rusty  having not been involved in an international match for more than a month  You cant rely on one batsman  yes the others have contributed  but still at the same time  if we can do a bit more with the bat at the top of the order and the middle overs  I think we will feel the pressure slightly less   India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after the Australia triumph  Also  it will be good  because still we feel we are batting at 65 percent  barring Virat  Kohli   CAPTAIN COOLDhoni faces the prospect of lifting a third World Cup for India after leading them in 2007 and again for the 50 overs title in 2011  the wicketkeeper lauded for his exceptional calmness and savvy against Bangladesh as India stole victory A win on Thursday will take India to a third final in the World Twenty20 under Dhoni after they went down to South Asian rivals Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh The strong form of his spinners and accuracy of pacemen Ashish Nehra and Jasprit Bumrah in the death overs will give Dhoni hope of taming the West Indies batsmen on a surface that has done little to help the bowlers in three matches South Africa saw a 230 run target chased down by England  who were on the receiving end of Chris Gayles assault when they failed to defend a score of 182 At the same ground  Afghanistan gave South Africa a scare while chasing 209 until they lost too many wickets in the second half of the innings on a surface offering little respite for the bowlers at a ground with relatively short boundaries Afghanistan also inflicted the only Super 10 defeat on West Indies with their spinners finding a way to restrict their powerful batsmen in Nagpur The 2012 champions rested Gayle for that game and a hamstring injury to Andre Fletcher  who has since been ruled out of the tournament and replaced by Lendl Simmons  hampered their chase further But the inability to chase down a modest 124 would have not gone unnoticed and skipper Darren Sammy is hoping it was just a one off and not a sign of inconsistency  We have to leave this game in Nagpur   Sammy said  Well leave this game here and see it as the blip in the tournament  Now we have two knockouts to play  Two more steps

Aggressive opening batsman Chris Gayle usually hogs the headlines but West Indies' advance to the World Twenty20 final against England has shown they are by no means a one man band  according to batsman Lendl Simmons Gayle scored an unbeaten century in the Caribbean side's first pool match against England  which set up their successful run chase of 183  reaching the target with 11 balls to spare in Mumbai  Since then  he has scored nine further runs He was dismissed for five in the semi final against India before Simmons smashed 82 from 51 balls  while Andre Russell scored 43 from 20 to guide their side into Sunday's showdown with Eoin Morgan's team in Kolkata on Sunday  I think England will certainly be aware that it's not a one man show in this team   Simmons told reporters  Chris Gayle didn't get off but we still managed to get over the line and it was a big total  Even when he didn't perform  we were still able to get up and fight and that shows a lot of character from our players  The team have needed to rely on their character and collective will after a turbulent few months in which they have been pilloried for their performances in test matches and one day internationals They have also been galvanised by yet another bitter pay dispute with their board  who less than two months ago threatened to send a second string side to the tournament in India unless the squad accepted their offer Since Gayle's blistering start to the tournament  others have assumed the mantle of trying to chase down the totals they have been set in all five games Andre Fletcher scored 84 not out in their seven wicket win over Sri Lanka  while Johnson Charles  32  and Marlon Samuels  43  saw them to a three wicket win over South Africa  Every one of our players are match winners in our team   Simmons added   We have a lot of batting power and I think we can chase any run total  we always back ourselves to chase totals  That confidence has also been evident in Morgan's side after they comfortably accounted for New Zealand in the other semi final  with man of the match Jason Roy epitomising the aggressive attitude that has filtered through the team That aggression  and confidence  made them a better outfit than the England team that won the World Twenty20 in 2010  according to the captain of that side  Paul Collingwood  In the past our line up probably had one or two players that were real match winners  this team is full of match winners   Collingwood told the ECB website  These guys are mentally different to what we used to be  'Who dares wins' is pretty much the motto  We probably would think  'this is a big game' and pull back a little bit  It seems to be the other way round for these guys  they seem to thrive on the excitement of the big stage  
West Indies will face a completely different England side in Sundays World Twenty20 final compared to the one they beat in the Super 10 stage match  captain Eoin Morgan said on the eve of the title clash Doubts crept in about Englands prospects in the sixth edition of the tournament after West Indies chased down a 182 run target at the Wankhede Stadium with almost two overs to spare  riding on an unbeaten century from opener Chris Gayle But the 2010 champions made significant improvement in their last two matches  including a morale boosting victory over an in form New Zealand side in the semi finals  to inch closer to a second T20 title  I think its two completely different teams given that we have grown as a side game on game   Morgan told reporters at the Eden Gardens on Saturday  I think its difficult to compare sides from the first game of the tournament to the final of the World Cup  While Gayle is due for a big score having made little impact on the tournament since his blitzkrieg against England  Morgan said England could not afford to only focus on the Jamaican  Even before we played West Indies in the group stages I was quite firm in saying that Chris Gayle wasnt just the West Indies team   said the 29 year old who is himself due for runs  Its important that when you are playing against good sides you do not focus on one or two good players Its everybody  because anybody can hurt you   Morgan added  I think India witnessed that and everybody watching the game witnessed that with Lendl Simmons innings  Barely 12 months back  England made an ignominious exit from the 50 over World Cup and were pilloried for their negative approach to limited overs cricket Morgan credits a change in mindset for their success  I think the strides we have made in the last 12 months  this would be a great reward for the mindset we have showed and the hard work we have put in   the left handed batsman added  Its quite a stark difference  Its hard to believe in some ways  I would have never imagined the turnaround being so immediate or having such an immediate impact   the key component within that has been the mindset  I think tomorrow the opportunity we do have is a product of that Its totally exciting   I am just very  very proud  Morgan hopes his team mates will not be overawed by the occasion in front of over 65 000 spectators at the iconic Eden Gardens  We know its not going to be a normal game  I want all of our players to embrace it and tomorrow everything is going to feel a bit rushed   he said  To start with its important that we are in a really good frame of mind to slow things down when needed and more importantly execute our skills  
West Indies rag tag army of short format mercenaries will be hoping they have the weapons to overcome a fearless England in Sundays World Twenty20 final as both sides target the honour of being the first to claim a second title in the tournament For a group of players who nearly boycotted the event over a contractual dispute with their board  Darren Sammy and his troops have waltzed into the Kolkata final displaying all the Caribbean flair that has earned them global admiration If Twenty20 cricket is essentially about power hitting  no team does it better and more unabashedly than the West Indies England have first hand knowledge of that destructive potency  having been blown away by Chris Gayles 47 ball century in a Super 10 shellacking in Mumbai a fortnight ago Revenge may be regarded as a dish best served cold but Eoin Morgans men would probably like nothing more than to exact it in the heat of a World Cup final A task easier said than done against a West Indies outfit packed with swashbuckling players who ply their trade in lucrative Twenty20 leagues around the globe What makes the job doubly difficult is that Sammys men have proved in India that they are more than just a one man army who bank on Gayle to punch holes in their opponents Marlon Samuels  Lendl Simmons and Andrew Russell have stepped out of their illustrious team mates shadow and made their own mark in the last month  We said this before the tournament that Chris is under pressure   Sammy said after the exhilarating semi final victory against hosts India  He is our best Twenty20 player but we have 15 match winners in this side   he added The ever smiling all rounder is seeking to become the first captain to lead a team to a second World Twenty20 title but West Indies are anything but infallible PEAKING ENGLANDThey showed two extremes to their game in the last couple of outings  slumping to an embarrassing defeat to qualifiers Afghanistan before silencing a raucous home crowd in Mumbai as they knocked out favourites India Also  the England they will face on Sunday is not the same team they thumped by six wickets in the group stage last month Morgans side have peaked gradually in the tournament since that defeat and seem to have found the right rhythm and combinations They accomplished a high scoring chase against South Africa  recovered well to subdue an upset minded Afghanistan  held their nerve to edge out Sri Lanka and stunned the previously unbeaten New Zealand with a near perfect game in the semi finals Their batsmen    especially Jason Roy  Joe Root and Jos Buttler    have batted with refreshing freedom and their catching has been extraordinary Equally  if not more impressive  has been their bowling at the death Ben Stokes appeared to have ice in his veins in the final over against Sri Lanka to thwart Angelo Mathewss audacious bid to pull off a sensational victory as England secured their place in the last four Against New Zealand  Stokes and Chris Jordan pacified the Black Caps in the final four overs  which cost only 20 runs and garnered five wickets  to restrict them to a total that England could chase down with 17 balls to spare Morgan has freed his batsmen from the weight of expectation and it is showing in the teams performance  Thats the way a lot of us play   Roy said of Englands aggressive batting after his 44 ball innings of 78 set the foundations for victory over New Zealand  The whole team has got that kind of licence  that kind of opportunity to go out there and do what they want and be free with their skills

The West Indies board has offered talks with its new World Twenty20 champions to defuse a longrunning dispute saying it wants to find ways of ensuring players dont turn their backs on international cricket The Windies victory in the final in Kolkata on Sunday night was soured by an outburst from skipper Darren Sammy who said it was disappointing the team had received no support from the board before the match Dave Cameron  the boards president responded by calling the comments inappropriate in a statement that reserved its warmest words for the tournament organisers rather than the victorious players However  Cameron did offer an olive branch by saying the board would meet players after the end of the Indian Premier League  IPL  next month to persuade them to play for the West Indies rather than opt for lucrative Twenty20 leagues We want to see how we can find common ground in ensuring that the best players in the region are available for selection for West Indies teams  Cameron said We are fully aware of the financial rewards on offer in the lucrative international T20 leagues but we believe deeply in the importance of cricket to the people of the region and of West Indies cricket s place in world cricket  It is therefore a priority to have all of our players competing and available for selection Relations between the board and team have often been poisonous in recent years with players furious over what they see as inadequate financial rewards A pay dispute two years ago led to the team flying home in the middle of a tour of India and the players only reluctantly agreed to sign contracts for the World T20 a few weeks before the tournament began Many senior players  such as Chris Gayle  no longer play Test matches instead turning out in T20 leagues where they can earn more money in six weeks than they are paid by their board in a year When the West Indies were thrashed by Australia in a Test series at the turn of the year  Gayle and Sammy were both unavailable for selection as they were playing in Australias Big Bash T20 tournament Amid growing fears that the proliferation of T20 leagues is turning some players away from Test matches  the International Cricket Council  ICC  has said it wants to draw up a time table to avoid clashes Many of the West Indies T20 champions are expected to play in the IPL which begins this coming weekend and ends in late May We are aware of that schedule hence the plan to meet at that time  said Cameron  We will also engage the ICC on this so that we protect not only the rich heritage and legacy of West Indies cricket but also its future  he added

Mitchell McClenaghan walked out at No  4 for Mumbai Indians  It is not like the side is short of hitters but Jos Buttler caught fire only after the spark provided by McClenaghan's eight ball 20  The events between the 11th and the 15th overs of the chase decided the winner of the match   Mumbai  by six wickets McClenaghan's responsibility   under normal circumstances   was to slip into Lasith Malinga's shoes  Be the wicket taker at the start and the enforcer at the end  Today  he was asked to disrupt the Kolkata Knight Riders' rhythm  And he was given the freedom to do so  Every single shot played by the New Zealand fast bowler was a slog  His second  third and fourth balls cleared the Eden Gardens boundaries  The eighth   a wide full toss that he tried to slog sweep   led to his downfall but by then Mumbai had regained lost momentum  And Buttler simply ran with it A straight drive against chinaman Brad Hogg was followed by a pulled six  The equation shrunk from 101 off 60 balls to 49 off 30  A scoop to the fine leg boundary   which established Buttler's finesse   and two lofted cover drives   which established his power   deflated Knight Riders  Gautam Gambhir  who had taken the record  27  for the most fifties in the IPL earlier in the night  watched the ball soar and the chances for his team sink with every minute Buttler was on strike When Buttler eventually fell for 41 off 22 balls  the Mumbai captain  Rohit Sharma  back at his preferred opening position  provided more evidence of why he should be given as many overs as possible in a T20 game  Rohit held the innings together and even finished it off with an array of beautiful shots   a straight six and a deft glide to third man  He followed those up with an outrageous sweep taking an overpitched delivery coming at him with the express pace of Andre Russell from around the wicket  and deposited it at the midwicket boundary

Royal Challengers Bangalore blasted the first 200 plus score of the tournament in an emphatic 45 run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium  In doing so  they also bucked the season's early trend of chasing teams prevailing AB de Villiers  82  and Virat Kohli  75  provided a visual treat courtesy a fine cocktail of fineness and brute force in a 157 run second wicket stand  before Shane Watson announced himself by muscling three successive sixes in an over from Karn Sharma  The final flourish was lent by Sarfaraz Khan  who in his typically unorthodox fashion  paddled and reverse paddled his way to an unbeaten 10 ball 35 as Royal Challengers finished with 227 for 4 Deflated and dejected  Sunrisers went for broke  wiping out 83 for the loss of Shikhar Dhawan in eight overs  David Warner  who returned to open after a brief flirtation in the middle order with Australia in the World T20  showed why he is one of the most feared white ball strikers  He muscled three sixes and five fours in a 21 ball half century before falling into the short ball trap laid by Watson The pressure of the required rate eventually got to Sunrisers and the chase went cold as the team lost Warner  Naman Ojha  Henriques and Deepak Hooda in the space of 17 deliveries  meaning they could only muster 182 for 6  Parvez Rasool was the pick of Royal Challengers' bowlers  returning 1 for 31 in a crafty spell of offspin bowling  even as Watson and Yuzvendra Chahal  the legspiner  chipped away with two wickets Chris Gayle's dismissal for 1 in the second over of the match to Bhuvneshwar Kumar  when the ball brushed the thigh pad and deflected onto the leg stump  was a rare moment to cheer for a listless Sunrisers bowling attack that was further depleted when Ashish Nehra  their pace spearhead  hobbled off the field after just 2 1 overs  That resulted in a batting feast for two men in a murderous mood as Royal Challengers blasted 139 off the last 10 overs The only semblance of respect from Kohli and de Villiers came early on when Mustafizur Rahman  making his IPL debut  troubled them with his cutters  Once the job of seeing off his initial burst   a two over spell   was done  they let loose  Sarfaraz's unbeaten 44 run stand off just 15 deliveries with Kedar Jadhav ensured Royal Challengers had momentum firmly by their side at the break Dhawan's early wicket to Rasool was a setback for Sunrisers  but Warner's muscle kept his team in the hunt as Kohli rang in the changes in a bid to pull things back  Adam Milne's second spell  in which he had Moises Henriques mistime a pull to midwicket  opened the game up  Once Royal Challengers had one foot in the door  it was a simple matter of forcing it open  which they did quite easily  In the end  even Ashish Reddy's big hitting was merely a footnote for Sunrisers in what was a forgettable outing

Lionel Messi's 500th career goal couldn't prevent Barcelona's incredible slump in form from continuing with a fourth defeat in five games 2 1 at home to Valencia on Sunday Atletico Madrid are now level on 76 points with Barca at the top of La Liga with five games remaining as they beat Granada 3 0  but the Catalans retain the lead thanks to their superior head to head record Third placed Real Madrid are also only a point behind thanks to their 5 1 win at Getafe on Saturday Valencia were beaten 7 0 by Barca on their last trip to the Camp Nou just two months ago under former boss Gary Neville  but gained revenge thanks to Ivan Rakitic's own goal and Santi Mina's classy finish before half time Messi ended a five game goal drought to bring up his 500th for club and country  but couldn't inspire a Barca fightback as their alarming collapse in recent weeks continued after a 39 game unbeaten run Having looked well set for a second consecutive treble just two weeks ago  Barca could now miss out on all three major trophies as they were dumped out of the Champions League by Atletico in midweek and have taken just one point from their last four La Liga games However  in contrast to recent defeats  Barca boss Luis Enrique praised the performance of his side and believes they are capable of winning their last five games to retain the title  Luck didn't shine on the team  I congratulate my players for how they faced the adversity during the game   said Enrique  We still depend on ourselves  Our margin for error has run out and we are aware of the challenge  Now we have a marvellous challenge  five games in which if we win them all we are champions Barca started brightly  but were repeatedly denied by fine saves from Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves The Brazilian blocked Messi's volley from close range before somehow springing to punch away Neymar's lob which seemed destined to evade him However  Valencia amazingly went in at half time two goals to the good having had just one shot on target The visitors went in front on 27 minutes when Rakitic turned Guilherme Siqueira's cross into his own net at the near post and doubled their lead thanks to a brilliant move in first half stoppage time as Dani Parejo played in Mina to fire into the far corner Rakitic had a huge chance to make amends for his own goal a minute into the second half  but pulled his effort tamely wide from Luis Suarez's fine cut back However  Barca were finally given hope when Jordi Alba's low cross was turned home by Messi to reach another historic landmark Alves came to Valencia's rescue once more with his best save of the night low to his right to prevent Rakitic equalising 15 minutes from time Neymar's fiercely struck volley was somehow deflected behind by Shkodran Mustafi  but Valencia should also have killed the game off at the other end when Paco Alcacer miscued from point blank range allowing Sergio Busquets to clear off the line Gerard Pique then had a glorious chance to salvage at least a point late on  but he pulled his shot wide with just Alves to beat In contrast to Barca's collapse  Atletico are flying in the final stages of the season as Fernando Torres struck his fourth goal in as many games in a routine win over Granada  It will be tough  to win the league   but we will play as the schedule demands us to which is to win  win and win again   said Atletico boss Diego Simeone Koke ensured Atletico would have no hangover from their efforts in dispatching Barca from the Champions League in midweek as he swept home the opener on 15 minutes before teeing up Torres to dink home just before the hour mark Substitute Angel Correa rounded off the scoring with a cool finish seven minutes from time

Virat Kohlis 48 ball 79 powered Royal Challengers Bangalore to 191 for 5  and AB de Villiers and Shane Watson chipped in with 55 and 33  But their efforts were put to shade by Quinton de Kock  who made a bruising 51 ball 108  the first hundred in IPL 2016  to power Delhi Daredevils to a seven wicket win at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium While De Kock starred in the lead role  Karun Nair  who hails from Bangalore  played the supporting role in 134 run third wicket stand that came off 76 balls Kohli showed he can be equally dangerous when setting targets  The groundwork was laid during the course of his second wicket stand of 107 with de Villiers before Daredevils hit back with a tremendous exhibition of late overs bowling courtesy the returning Mohammed Shami and Chris Morris  who conceded only 27 off the last four overs Daredevils were dealt an early blow when Shreyas Iyer was dismissed by Shane Watson but it had little effect on de Kock as he pierced a packed off side field for three fours off the offspinner Parvez Rasool in the second over De Kock was particularly punishing through the off side  a majority of his runs coming behind square  Once he was set  the other elements to his game surfaced  A nonchalant flick off Harshal Patel in the ninth over soared over deep square leg  and once he was into the 90s he used the pace to scoop the ball over short fine leg  The end result was a wagon wheel with spokes all around the wicket De Kock's sparkling form helped Daredevils ride a trough when Sanju Samson struggled to play his shots  but his dismissal in the sixth over turned their fortunes  Nair and de Kock got stuck in against Yuzvendra Chahal  Harshal Patel and David Wiese  whose combined tally at one point was 78 conceded off seven overs  Their predictability put immense pressure on Watson to deliver with the ball as the equation came down to 56 off the last six overs De Kock brought up his century off his 48th ball  Once into the home stretch  there was a sense of inevitability to the game  After De Kock walked off to a round of applause from Watson  who had him caught behind  Duminy struck the winning runs  Chahal fielding his straight punch but giving away an overthrow with an underarm flick to try and catch Nair out of his crease

HYDERABAD  David Warners unbeaten 59 ball 90 steered Sunrisers Hyderabad to their first win of the season after their bowlers had kept Mumbai Indians to 142 in conditions that led to a well matched contest between bat and ball Southee kept Mumbai in the game with three well timed wickets  starting with a late swinging yorker to Shikhar Dhawan  but Mumbai kept feeding Warner a steady supply of release balls  which he put away merrily He ended the game with two sixes in three balls  flat batting Mitchell McClenaghan over mid off and pulling him over deep square leg  and Sunrisers were home with 15 balls remaining  Mumbai's defeat was their third in four matches It only took four balls for Bhuvneshwar Kumar to strike  though it was swing rather than seam that did the damage  With Kieron Pollard out due to food poisoning  Mumbai had brought in Martin Guptill  and his debut innings in the IPL was terminated by a perfectly pitched outswinger that kissed his edge through to the wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel looked distinctly uncomfortable against the swinging ball  playing and missing repeatedly before he was bowled by a back of the hand slower ball from Barinder Sran that jagged in like a left arm wristspinner's googly  Then came a self inflicted wound   Rohit  who came in at No  4  running himself out while looking for a suicidal single  When Jos Buttler  surprised by extra pace from Sran  gloved an attempted pull in the 11th over  they were 60 for 4 and going nowhere At the crease now were Ambati Rayudu  who had been promoted to No  3  and Krunal Pandya  who had been promoted to No  6 ahead of his brother Hardik  who had batted at No  3 in all of Mumbai's previous matches  All the meddling with the batting order indicated a muddled think tank  but Rayudu and Krunal made the most of their opportunities Moises Henriques and the left arm spinner Bipul Sharma varied their pace cleverly in the middle overs  But Bipul  who had gone for only 14 off his first three overs  was struck three successive sixes by Krunal in the 14th over  Rayudu stepped out and hit one himself  and Bipul finished with figures of 0 for 40

Kolkata Knight Riders thrashed Kings XI Punjab by six wickets here on Sunday to go on top of the table in the Indian Premier League 2016 Knight Riders' bowling depth was perceptible as their spinners ripped through Kings XI  in a sub par batting performance  to keep them to 138 for 8 In the chase  Robin Uthappa's quickfire fifty effectively sealed the game  In 13 games this season  12 have been won by the chasing team Put in to bat  Kings XI lost Manan Vohra early when he flicked Morne Morkel to deep square leg but M Vijay looked in rhythm  scything drives and cuts before failing to pick a googly from Piyush Chawla The stage was set for either of David Miller or Glenn Maxwell to fire their side back into the contest  but Knight Riders' experienced bowling attack strangled their strong middle order With two left handers batting   Marsh and Miller   Gautam Gambhir turned to Yusuf Pathan for the first time this season  The move reaped rewards instantly when Miller edged Yusuf's first ball and Uthappa took a sharp catch Maxwell soon resorted to a switch hit off Sunil Narine  but Kings XI's season was summed up when he hammered it to extra cover  Narine's remodeled action returned two wickets in a frugal spell with an economy rate of 5 50 In a format where teams target implausible numbers during the second half of an innings  Knight Riders' spinners ensured Kings XI could only rebuild after leaving them at 94 for 5 in the 15th over In between  Marsh used swift footwork to accumulate runs and was particularly effective square of the wicket  on both sides  He got to his fifty in the last over with a sweetly timed lofted drive over long on  Along with Kyle Abbott  he took Andre Russell's first over   the last of the innings   for 18 to lift Kings XI to 138 Kings XI needed a miraculous start but Uthappa and Gambhir pushed Knight Riders closer to the target with nine boundaries in a 65 run Powerplay  the most productive in this season The seamers  Sandeep Sharma and Abbott  were inconsistent but when they found their lengths  Uthappa cleared the infield with lofted strokes on the up  on a pitch offering even bounce and carry Uthappa eased himself to his first fifty of the season off just 24 balls but his premeditated sweep resulted in his dismissal  as he played around a full delivery from Pardeep Sahu  Gambhir looked set for another fifty before a leading edge was acrobatically taken by Glenn Maxwell  running in from deep midwicket Axar Patel removed Manish Pandey and Shakib Al Hasan  but Suryakumar Yadav and Yusuf took Knight Riders home with 17 balls to spare

Rohit Sharmas 44 ball 62 helped Mumbai Indians to overhaul Royal Challengers Bangalore' 170 for seven with 12 balls to spare here at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday His batting was fluid as he took charge of the chase along with Ambati Raid  who was anything but elegant yet equally effective during his 31 The second wicket stand of 76 in 55 balls laid the platform for Mumbai's chase  before Iqbal Abdulla gave Royal Challengers a new lease of life by dismissing Rayudu and Rohit in quick succession  both to slogs Mumbai were 109 for three then  needing 62 off seven overs   well on track as dew took effect  Jos Buttler and Kieron Pollard  returning from food poisoning  flexed their muscles by hitting five sixes between them  and Mumbai recorded their second win in five matches Mumbai  who opted to bowl  were staring at a 200 plus target as Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers feasted on some friendly bowling during the course of a 59 run stand  before the unheralded players  in what was billed as a battle of two heavyweight teams  rose to the occasion Krunal Pandyas twin strikes to get rid of Kohli and de Villiers in the space of five deliveries stunned Royal Challengers  Shane Watson fell not long after  but then Travis Head  on IPL debut  and Sarfaraz Khan lifted Royal Challengers from 99 for 4 to 170 for 7 KL Rahul was put through a short ball test in a hostile burst by Mitchell McClenaghan  during which he was hit hard on the helmet  After the early jitters  though  he ramped and slapped his way to 23 before being caught in the slips  Kohli and de Villiers then counterpunched before the cluster of wickets resulted in a complete breakdown in momentum Head took his time to settle in before exhibiting his ball striking power to swat Hardik Pandya for six over deep square leg in the 15th over  Sarfaraz showed there is more to his game than just scoops and paddles as he milked the spinners before clubbing Jasprit Bumrah for two successive sixes in the final over Mumbai lost Parthiv Patel in the second over of the chase  but Varun Aaron's third over  which went for 19  brought their innings back on track  Once Royal Challengers' uncapped Indian bowlers were summoned  a game that was only marginally tilted in Mumbai's favour turned decisively in their direction  Abdulla's wickets injected a touch of excitement  but any possibility of a close finish was firmly snuffed out by Pollard's charge 
Batting coach Grant Flower has claimed that Pakistani batsmen are not as hard working as far as fitness is concerned saying our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice Flower said Pakistani batsmen remain in the elusion that whatever they have been doing in order to keep themselves fit is enough for them to excel in the international circuit At the international level most of the guys techniques are sound  With Pakistan  it is more trying to get the routine right but it is also about the preparation off the field regarding fitness  Flower told ESPNCricinfo You not only need that in fielding and bowling but equally in batting <br/> If you are physically fit it will definitely lead to a good life style and better judgement at the crease he said Flower said  our players are very inconsistent with the way they practice  They do work on their weak areas but they could do a lot more  When you are an international player you should be waking up and asking yourself what I have to do more to improve myself  If you are not answering that question then I dont think you should be there  he said Flower said that the upcoming camp for the national team ahead of their tour of England will also have a session with a psychologist He said he hopes that the upcoming camp will also cover the psychologist session and the players take that in a positive manner Flower said it requires a lot of sacrifice to play for the country A good student of the game learns everyday life style gym work and all those things required to be a better cricketer  he said He claimed that it is not like 20 minutes in the gym and 20 minutes in the nets <br/> It is about quality time absorbing everything rather than just being seen doing the right stuff and walking away saying that I have done enough  A lot of guys kid themselves They think they are doing enough to be playing for Pakistan and getting great results  I know a lot of time they are not doing enough  Sometimes I wish they could see how worldclass players prepare and what it takes They watch a lot of cricket but I dont know if they really digest what they see to get to the top  he said  
Paul Hawkins  the inventor of the balltracking HawkEye ball tracking system has now come up with a bat sensor to pick up nicks perfectly <br/> The sensor is the size of a small coin and uses an accompanying smart phone app to detect the nicks The on field umpires will have to attach the smart phones to their jackets to film each ball so that instant replays and ball trajectories can be replayed and monitored  a prominent sports website www sportskeeda com reported The tiny sensor which costs 25  AUD46  can easily be fixed to the bat for the phone to film and monitor the ball Hawkins  who was a former county player and a missile guidance expert  has confirmed that the technology is almost ready to be used and might be introduced into amateur cricket in England soon Hawkins had been watching a Hampshire cricket league match last year and had been left very disappointed to see a batsman stand his ground after being out caught behind as the umpire failed to detect the edge That incident has led Hawkins to come up with his ingenious technological innovation to change cricket Batsmen have always not walked but what really got me was that after the inevitable bout of sledging from the fielders the batsman said I know I nicked it and you know I did but so what it wasnt given Hawkins was quoted as saying  More and more batsmen try and get away with it  We got him out soon afterwards but it ruined my day Hawkins technology works much like the realtime Snicko meter with the bat sensor picking up vibrations in the bat and making the results readily available on the smart phones to be worn by the on field umpires We experimented in the nets and found that even the finest edge a feather that the bowler didnt hear is detected  Hawkins said

Amir Khan will have to produce one of the greatest displays ever seen by a British boxer if he is to beat WBC middleweight champion Saul Alvarez in Las Vegas on Saturday  according to Ricky Hatton The 29 year old  like fellow Briton Hatton a former light welterweight world champion  has moved up two weight divisions   putting on the best part of 10 kilos   to take on flame haired Mexican Alvarez  whose only defeat in 48 fights came against Floyd Mayweather Jr in 2013 Khan is a huge underdog against Alvarez  nicknamed Canelo  the Spanish word for cinnamon  because of his hair  but Hatton believes he could pull off an upset  Its a big ask  He has the tools to do it and I hope he does it  but its a massive  massive ask to keep out of trouble for 12 rounds against Alvarez who has improved so much since the Mayweather fight   Hatton told Reuters  If he does pull it off  going from welterweight to middleweight and winning the title  it would be one of the best wins in British boxing history I think   Hatton knows firsthand the dangers of moving up a weight He suffered his first career defeat when Mayweather knocked him out in a WBC welterweight world title bout in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same fighter again According to the 37 year old Hatton  who is now a boxing promoter having hung up his gloves in 2012  Khan must not get involved in a slug fest with the more powerful Alvarez and use his superior movement to stay out of trouble  Its a fight that I didnt think would be made   said Hatton  whose stable includes upcoming British heavyweight Nathan Gorman  Amir always has good fights  but he needs to make this one boring  If he tries to have a go with this lad  I dont think he needs me to tell him  he needs to use his speed  move  move The moment he stops moving those feet  he will be in trouble because Alvarez is a big puncher  Hattons concern is that by putting on some extra pounds to move up  Khan may have slowed down for what will be his first fight in a year since beating American Chris Algieri  I dont think its the hand speed  Its the foot speed  Amir is not a fighter like Mayweather  he is more straight backed   He has to use his feet to be defensive

Rafael Nadal is convinced that none of his rivals are taking performance enhancing drugs and believes that people who have accused him of doping have  personal problems  The Spaniard is suing former French cabinet minister Roselyne Bachelot after she alleged earlier this year that he had failed a drugs test  He used an interview with El Mundo published on Saturday to defend him and other top players I have total confidence that all my rivals are totally clean  he said  I have no doubt about that  first of all because I believe in the anti doping program and secondly because I believe in people until they show you otherwise The 14 times grand slam winner said that people who have accused him of doping are unhappy with their own lives  and do not like his style of play  They do it because evidently they have a personal problem and are unhappy with themselves  and then they look further  at the technical aspect  perhaps only because of my way of fighting for every point  my style of play  which Ive had throughout my career  Former world number one Nadal  who will attempt to win a 10th French Open title this year  strenuously denies ever having taken performance enhancing substances and has never failed a drug test He is taking legal action against Bachelot after she said on French television in March that his seven month absence from the Tour through injury in 2012 was  probably due to a positive doping test  Nadal said he had resisted the urge to take legal action against people who have accused him of doping in the past  but was compelled to act following Bachelot's comments When these things keep being repeated  and someone who is supposed to be in a serious position says something and people start to think that person has privileged information  then it is more serious  he said When someone like that makes gratuitous and false comments with no information  there comes a time when you have to stop and you have to fight because of who you are and what you have been all your life Failed drug tests in elite tennis are rare but doping has been in the spotlight since former women's world number one Maria Sharapova announced in March she had returned a positive test for banned substance meldonium

The ICC has opened discussions with broadcasters about organising World Twenty20 tournaments in 2018 and 2022  thus the event will be played every two years This means two extra World Cups will be added to the existing schedule as it looks to cash in on the booming popularity of the games shortest format After the success of the World Twenty20 in India recently  the ICC does not want to wait another four years for the next tournament  which is due to be staged in Australia in 2020 This was proposed at the ICC recent board meeting in Dubai about holding a World Twenty20 every two years with West Indies a possibility for the proposed 2018 tournament and the UAE in 2022  The proposal is expected to be added to the agenda for the ICCs annual general meeting in Edinburgh at the end of June for formal discussion An informal sounding out of broadcasters has begun about adding the tournaments to the recent $2 billion  1 4 billion  rights deal signed with Star Sports in 2014 that runs until 2023  That deal included a World Twenty20 this year and in 2020 after the ICC decided to place its three global tournaments  the World Cup  Champions Trophy and World Twenty20  on a four year cycle But the collapse of the Twenty20 Champions League  which featured domestic teams from around the world  has left a hole in the calendar in September October  a time which is suitable for cricket in seven of the nine Test playing nations Sources have confirmed the ICC has explored the possibility of holding the mens World Twenty20 in the West Indies in 2018  possibly as a run in or at the same as the womens version is due to take place in the Caribbean  But the problem with the Caribbean is the time difference makes it incompatible with the Indian market  where the vast broadcast deals are on offer Another possibility is South Africa  although the government there recently banned its cricket board from hosting global tournament because it had failed to meet racial quotas  The UAE has the infrastructure to host the tournament and the time difference works well with India  England is a non starter because this country is already hosting the 2017 Champions Trophy and 2019 World Cup The recent World Twenty20 was hailed by the ICC for bringing in record television ratings  The group match between Pakistan and India was watched by 83 million people and in this country the pulsating final between England and West Indies brought Sky Sports a peak of 2 45 million viewers  the channels highest rating for a cricket match Tweets about the World Twenty20 received 5 75 billion impressions and the ICC claimed 46 million people engaged with the tournament on Facebook  It is a fact that the ICC World Twenty20 2016 engaged with fans  old and new  like never before  said Dave Richardson  the ICCs chief executive

Wayne Rooney and Marcus Rashford scored to lift Manchester United to a comfortable 3 1 win over Bournemouth on Tuesday that secured fifth place in the Premier League table The game was hastily rearranged after the match on Sunday was abandoned due to a bomb scare and the first half was very low key in front of a sparse Old Trafford crowd The one moment of quality produced a fine goal  however  just before the interval when United's French forward Anthony Martial injected pace down the left and Rashford stepped over his cross to leave Rooney with a simple finish The 18 year old Rashford provided another example of his burgeoning talent with a clinical finish  his eighth goal since making his debut in February  in the 74th minute and Ashley Young added United's third before defender Chris Smalling's stoppage time own goal gave Bournemouth a consolation

A diligent half century from Alex Hales  coupled with some home ground know how from Jonny Bairstow  helped England to regroup with a 88 run stand for the sixth wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka  after their ambitions had been dramatically dented by the loss of five wickets for 34 runs either side of the lunch break By tea  Hales was unbeaten on 71  his second Test half century in nine innings and his highest yet  beating the 60 he made against South Africa at Cape Town in January At the other end was Bairstow  who arrived at the crease with England's innings in crisis at 83 for 5  but responded with the sort of sparky counter punching  Bairstow's 54 not out from 67 balls took the attack back to Sri Lanka  who nevertheless remained firmly in the contest at 171 for 5  thanks to Dasun Shanaka's sensational debut breakthroughs After being put into bat on a morning when bowling first was a no brainer for both captains  England's openers were obliged to rein in the extravagant strokeplay that has coloured so much of their cricket in recent months   a situation that might have been tailor made for Alastair Cook  He began the match needing another 36 runs to reach 10 000 Test runs  and after getting off the mark with a sixth ball clip for four through midwicket  appeared well set for the long grind until Shanaka's introduction  in the 18th over of the day  tore up the pre conceived script Shanaka launched his Test career with a maiden before striking with the first ball of his second over  Cook had been leaving the ball with his usual sangfroid for most of his 52 deliveries  but having creamed one cover drive off Nuwan Pradeep  he was drawn into another from the slower  wobblier Shanaka  The full length outside off left him a touch  and Cook scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal  the keeper  He was gone for 16  and still needs another 20 runs to notch up a landmark that has been on his conscience since the start of the South Africa tour in December Three balls later  however  such thoughts had been whisked out of England's minds  Nick Compton   whose anxieties cannot have been aided by his team mates' struggles to impose themselves   poked with caution at a perfect off stump line and length  to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip  He was gone for a duck as Shanaka became only the third bowler in Test history  and the first since Richard Johnson in 2003  to claim two wickets before conceding his first career run And  as if that was not enough of an impact on debut  Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally  as Joe Root   in such golden touch in all formats   was also drawn into a drive that scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip It was a dream start for Shanaka  who had been awarded his Test cap by Mahela Jayawardene before the start of play  and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too  who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad  their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago  will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury By tea  however  Hales and Bairstow had provided their team with a steadying hand  as a forecast rain shower swept in from the Pennines to delay the resumption of play 
Alastair Cooks bid to become the first England batsman to reach 10 000 Test runs had been relegated to an afterthought by lunch on the first morning of the first Test at Headingley  as the Sri Lanka debutant Dasun Shanaka claimed three wickets for one run in the space of eight balls to cut a swathe through England's much heralded top order By lunch  Cook had been dismissed for 16   still 20 runs shy of his landmark   with Nick Compton and Joe Root  the local hero and newly crowned England Test player of the year  both following for ducks in a sensational ten minute spell before lunch It was left to Alex Hales  who had been growing in confidence on 38 after an anxious first hour  and England's own debutant  James Vince  to glue the innings together  Vince had yet to get off the mark after 15 balls of watchful defence  as England settled for a lunchtime scoreline   and a definite bout of indigestion   of 57 for 3 Shanaka had been brought on to bowl the 19th over of the innings with England apparently looking solid on 44 for 0 after Cook and Hales had seen off the new ball danger of Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep Instead  having launched his Test career with a maiden  Shanaka struck with his seventh delivery to tempt Cook with a fuller length outside off  and scuffed an edge through to Dinesh Chandimal  the keeper Then  three balls later  Compton poked with caution at a perfect off stump line and length  to squeeze a low edge through to Lahiru Thirimanne at first slip Shanaka then added England's main man to his tally  as Root   in such golden touch in all formats   was also drawn into a drive as Shanaka's wobbly medium pace left his shot just a fraction and scudded to Kusal Mendis at third slip instead It was a dream start for Shanaka and a timely boost for a beleaguered Sri Lanka squad too  who began the match knowing that Dhammika Prasad  their matchwinning seamer on this ground two years ago  will miss the whole Test series after flying home to resolve a shoulder injury The second hour of the session also featured a lively but unsuccessful introduction for Sri Lanka's pacy young quick bowler  Dushmantha Chameera  as well as a typically accurate probe from the spinner  Rangana Herath  whose solitary over was blocked out for a maiden by Hales before the break Both sides are wearing black armbands in recognition of the floods that are currently affecting Sri Lanka 
Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur feels that if there would be a role for Shahid Afridi in Pakistan cricket then he will be brought back Mickey said Afridi has been a fantastic player for Pakistan for many years and you don t discard phenomenal players like that very easily If we think there is a role for him we will certainly bring him back but that is a discussion for the future and another time There s a lot of cricket to be played before we get to that discussion he told Pakpassion net Speaking about Pakistan struggling in twenty20 cricket Mickey said one learns a lot from franchise cricket tournaments Not playing in the Indian Premier League  IPL  could be affecting the performances of the Pakistan team in the twenty20 over format  he said He further said that the Head Coach should be part of the selection panel I think the Head Coach has a role to play on that panel but it is also good in some instances that you have people who are part of the team environment also selecting otherwise you select for now and forget about the future  he said Mickey said working with three different captains in Pakistan cricket would be a little bit difficult I will discuss it with chief selector Inzamam ul Haq and see what he thinks is the best way forward and we will go from there Ideally you want two captains as a maximum across the three formats That is something we will look at even if it is three different captains that can be fine We will do what is best  he said Talking about plans with the Pakistan Cricket Board  PCB  hesaid he always likes to have goals and targets set for him and the team But again they will be small and little steps to start with You have to crawl before you walk or run I will keep assessing those goals and as we move up I will be able to assess the goals and standards we want  he said 
English Premier League champions Leicester City paid a visit to Bangkok's glittering Grand Palace on Thursday and signed a well wishing book for the country's revered monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej The 88 year old Thai king ascended the throne 70 years ago and is the world's longest reigning monarch  but various ailments have kept him in hospital for a year The squad  led by manager Claudio Ranieri and captain Wes Morgan  did not meet the king but gathered with thousands of tourists at one of Bangkok's top spots for visitors The Thai owned club are on an end of season tour to celebrate their improbable ascendancy to the top of the Premier League following a campaign they started as 5000 1 outsiders for the title but ended as champions by a 10 point margin Billionaire club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha  who led the party to the Grand Palace  said on Wednesday that he hoped the lessons learned by Leicester in their stunning season could serve to help Thailand's national team to a similar success  We want to help Thailand go to the World Cup   said Vichai  who bought the club in 2010  Thailand can be at the top  just like Leicester City  While at the Grand Palace  Vichai placed the Premier League trophy on a flower decked table in front of an alter dedicated to the king  flanked by his son Aiyawatt and Ranieri Soccer is hugely popular in the Southeast Asian nation but Thailand have had little success on the world stage Thailand have never qualified for a World Cup but are one of the remaining 12 Asian teams competing for four spots at the next tournament in Russia 2018 The duty free franchise that has made Vichai one of Thailand's richest man is named King Power  in a reference to King Bhumibol It is also the name of Leicester's home ground in Britain's Midlands after his company bought the naming rights in 2011 before buying the stadium outright two years later The team will later hold a victory parade in central Bangkok 
The concept of day night test found a new taker in England with board chairman Colin Graves confirming the country will host a twilight test Australia and New Zealand played the first floodlit test last November at Adelaide Oval and the innovation is taking roots across Asia India and Pakistan are scheduled to play day night tests this year while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are considering following suit pending the results of domestic trials  Full Story   You can't turn your back on it  it will happen   England and Wales Cricket Board Chairman Graves told BBC Sport  We just have to decide when it is going to happen  We're doing a lot of work on it and we'd love to see day night cricket  The first floodlit test at Adelaide Oval lasted only three days raising doubts if the pink ball can last the duration of the required number of overs in an innings But the test also attracted more than 123 000 fans through the gates at the picturesque ground  a welcome sight at a time when the game's longest format is grappling with dwindling crowds with the advent of the shortest Twenty20 format England has also attempted a minor shake up by proposing a points based system to determine the winner of their home series against Sri Lanka beginning on Thursday The points based system is aimed at injecting more excitement into the tour and add context to matches that otherwise maybe of merely academic interests Graves said work needed to be done to make the longest format more exciting and relevant  We have to make test cricket meaningful and we have to put some 'oomph' behind it   Graves said  Test cricket is safe if we do something about it  but I don't think it is safe if we do nothing  That is not an option  The International Cricket Council are looking at it and the other countries are looking at it 
A Chinese magnate has agreed to buy historic English football club Aston Villa  the latest in a series of investments from China into football worldwide as President Xi Jinping looks to make the country a global powerhouse in the sport The deal  reportedly worth 60 million pounds  $88 million   will see the chairman of little known Recon Group  Xia Jiantong  become the first mainland Chinese to fully own an English team Under the leadership of Xi  an avid fan  China has made it a goal to one day win the World Cup  and has ploughed huge amounts of investment into grassroots academies  television rights  transfer deals for overseas players and investment in clubs abroad More broadly  Beijing is aiming to grow the domestic sports market to 5 trillion yuan  $782 billion  by 2025  about five times its current scale China's biggest overseas investment in football so far occurred in December last year  when a consortium led by state backed China Media Capital took a $400 million stake in the owner of Villa's far larger and wealthier rival  Manchester City The Villa deal  however  with 100 percent ownership  is not just an investment  The Chinese ownership now get to decide how to run the club   said Mark Dreyer  Beijing based founder of sports information website China Sports Insider Crosstown arch rivals Birmingham City are also run from Asia  following the 2009 takeover by Hong Kong businessman Carson Yeung Villa's American owner Randy Lerner  who put the club on the market in 2014  struck the deal after former English champions Villa suffered a miserable season that left them relegated from the country's top football league Recon Group  Xia's privately owned holding company  owns a controlling interest in five publicly listed companies on the Hong Kong and Chinese stock exchanges The deal with American educated Xia  39  ends an unhappy tenure for Lerner  who bought the midlands club for 62 2 million pounds in 2006  Fans have openly demonstrated against his continued involvement with Villa  who were European champions in 1982 and have won the English top flight title seven times The club ended the recent season bottom of the English Premier League table  with only half the number of points of the next worst team  Aston Villa's relegation really played in their favour   said Fredrik van Huynh  Shanghai based director of HHC Sports Group   It will have pushed down the price quite significantly  Xia  who studied at Harvard University and has a doctorate  took to his official microblog late on Wednesday to wish the club's fans  health and happiness  Earlier this month he posted   Go  Villa  Go  We will be back  The club said Xia's immediate objective was  to return Aston Villa to the Premier League and then to have the club finish in the top six  bringing European football back to Villa Park  It added the deal would also help make Villa the most famous football club in China Dreyer at China Sports Insider dismissed that as  simply ludicrous   given the appeal of much bigger rivals such as Spain's Barcelona and England's Manchester United and Arsenal  I think fans of the club will remain sceptical until it becomes clear what his true motivations are   he added  $1   0 6837 pounds 
Sevilla conjured up a dazzling comeback to clinch a record third successive Europa League title on Wednesday  flooring Liverpool with a 3 1 victory that showed why the Spanish side have become masters of Europe's second tier competition Sevilla captain Coke lifted the trophy at Basel's St Jakob Park having been the architect of their heroics  scoring twice to leave Liverpool gasping on the canvas after Kevin Gameiro had cancelled out Daniel Sturridge's opener It was a remarkable turnaround after Liverpool had dominated the first half so completely that Juergen Klopp's side should have been home and dry  but they failed to inflict further damage when their opponents were reeling Unai Emery's team hit back with three goals in 25 minutes  the first coming just 17 seconds after the interval  to claim the trophy for the fifth time in 11 seasons and become the first side in 40 years to win three consecutive European competitions  At Sevilla we love this competition and we love it so much and we want it so much that we won it   Emery said   It is our competition and we underlined that once again  For Liverpool and Klopp  who has now suffered successive final defeats in his seven months in charge after February's League Cup disappointment  it was a dispiriting occasion His team's hopes of Champions League qualification were dashed  leaving Liverpool to face up to a season with no European competition  The players are still young   Klopp told reporters   We will use this experience today and someday everyone will say Basel was a decisive moment for Liverpool FC  It had looked  however  like being an entirely different outcome at the interval The opening goal arrived after 35 minutes and was a genuine moment of class from Sturridge  who received the ball on the left edge of the area before expertly picking his spot with a pin point curling finish off the outside of his left boot The England striker had already had a header hacked off the line and Liverpool had two vociferous penalty appeals for handball waved away by referee Jonas Eriksson as they turned the screw on their opponents The halftime whistle came to Sevilla's rescue  however  allowing them to regroup before clawing themselves off the ropes with an immediate sucker punch Seconds had elapsed before Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno  whose mistakes have cost his side on a number of occasions this season  darted hopelessly into a tackle on Mariano Ferreira  who skipped past him and crossed for Gameiro to side foot into an empty net Then it was Liverpool's turn to hit the panic button as Gameiro wasted two further chances before Coke added a second after 63 minutes Vitolo danced through a series of Liverpool tackles before the ball landed invitingly for the Sevilla skipper to curl his finish into the corner The final nail in Liverpool's coffin sparked fury on the touchline as Coke kept his cool to bury his second goal beneath Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet  only for the linesman to briefly raise his flag before putting it down again After some pushing and shoving the goal stood  leaving Liverpool with a mountain to climb Having retreated so far into their shell  however  they were incapable of rising above base camp 
The England pace attack ripped out Sri Lanka for 91 after Jonny Bairstow made an excellent century to put the hosts in complete control of the first Test on the second day in Leeds on Friday Bairstows superb knock of 140 lifted England to 298 in their first innings before James Anderson and Stuart Broad took nine wickets between them in favourable conditions for seam bowling at Headingley England captain Alastair Cook enforced the follow on and the touring side negotiated two deliveries to reach one for no wicket before bad light ended play  Sri Lanka trail by 206 runs in the opening match of the three Test series England had resumed in the morning on 171 for five and Bairstow and Alex Hales extended their sixth wicket partnership to 141  Hales  on 86  was in sight of his maiden test century when he skied spinner Rangana Herath to deep extra cover Moeen Ali  nought  and Broad  two  were dismissed by Dushmantha Chameera in the same over but Bairstow  dropped on 70  completed his second Test hundred and celebrated the achievement enthusiastically on his home ground Bairstow found a solid partner in Steven Finn  the pair adding 56 for the ninth wicket before the former skied a catch to mid on off Chameera Sri Lanka made a dreadful start to their reply as experienced fast bowlers Anderson and Broad exploited the conditions superbly Dimuth Karunaratne  Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis all edged catches to wicketkeeper Bairstow  leaving the tourists in deep trouble at 12 for three Dinesh Chandimal  on 15  was well held by James Vince at third slip off Ben Stokes before Anderson trapped captain Angelo Mathews lbw for 34 and then dismissed Dasun Shanaka first ball that the batsman nicked to Bairstow Herath was smartly caught by Stokes in the slips off Anderson for one  Chameera  2  drove Broad to Finn at mid off and Lahiru Thirimanne  on 22  was caught by Finn at mid on off Broad Anderson completed his 19th five wicket haul in Tests and outstanding figures of five for 16 when he had Shaminda Eranga caught by Bairstow down the leg side 
England took command on the second afternoon of the first Test at Headingley after Jonny Bairstow played a brilliant counter punching innings of 140 and later added three catches behind the stumps  With a total of 298 to defend  Stuart Broad and James Anderson produced another classy display of seam and swing bowling to leave the Sri Lankans rattled on 43 for 3 at tea It was a situation far removed from the 83 for 5 scoreline that had confronted Bairstow when he walked out to bat shortly after lunch on the first day  And with the new ball jagging alarmingly from a full length as Broad and Anderson brought all of their huge experience to bear  it took a gutsy response from Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal  Sri Lanka's most experienced pairing  to reach the break without further damage Faced with grey skies and a packed cordon  Sri Lanka's openers  Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva betrayed their anxieties in the very first over  when they hesitated so long over a quick single that they could have ended up shaking hands in the middle of the pitch Instead  they simply waved goodbye in the space of five deliveries as  first  Broad straightened one off the seam to kiss the edge of the left handed Karunaratne  who departed for a 12 ball duck  before Anderson drew level with Kapil Dev on 434 career wickets by finding some extra lift to dispose of Silva for 11 One over later  and Broad had two wickets in three balls as he went wide on the crease to spear an angled full length ball into Kusal Mendis' forward defence  for Bairstow to snaffle the slenderest of deflections behind the stumps Chandimal and Mathews  however  stood firm in a 31 run stand before the interval The story of the day  however  remained Bairstow's happy homecoming   a second Test century and his first at his Yorkshire home  Continuing the theme that Bairstow and his fellow not out batsman  Alex Hales  had established on the first afternoon  England's sixth wicket pair extended their stand to 141 to banish the memories of the top order wobble  when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs At the other end  Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century  But he faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack  Hales' patience snapped for good  In Herath's second over  he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers  A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover  who pouched the offering with a well judged dive If Hales' failing had been to linger too long  then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali  England's No  8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country  but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion  He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth  from Chameera  and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad  to Mendis under the helmet at short leg It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera  bowling only his second over of the day  He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work  but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Broad drove flat footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread eagled his own stumps via an inside edge Bairstow simply stared down the track  rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst  But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session  From the first ball of Chameera's next over  Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers  paused as a wild shy came in at the non striker's end  then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil 
Jonny Bairstow brought up his second Test century  and his first on his home ground at Headingley  as England continued their fightback on the second morning of the first Test against Sri Lanka  However  with Alex Hales falling short in his own quest for three figures  Sri Lanka battled back with three wickets in the second hour of the session  and will be armed with a brand new ball when play resumes after lunch Continuing the theme that Hales and Bairstow had established on the first afternoon  the pair extended their sixth wicket stand to 141 to banish the memories of England's top order wobble  when five wickets had tumbled for 34 runs  Bairstow was once again the aggressor  as befits a man in supreme form on his Yorkshire home ground   his last two innings at the venue have been 246 and 198 Bairstow outscored his partner by three to one throughout their morning resumption  capitalising on too much width as both Sri Lanka openers  Shaminda Eranga and Nuwan Pradeep  offered opportunities to fillet the third man boundary  He did enjoy one clear moment of good fortune however  on 70  when Pradeep failed to gather a sharp return catch to his right  as Bairstow scuffed a drive back down the track At the other end  Hales wound his neck in and banished all risk from his game as he set his sights on the remaining 29 runs he needed for his maiden Test century  It was a grind  as he routinely refused to chase anything outside his eyeline  except for one clear opportunity on 82  when Dimuth Karunaratne failed to cling onto a flying edge at slip off the bowling off Angelo Mathews It could have been the slice of luck that Hales needed  But four runs later  and faced with a change of tempo as Rangana Herath came into the attack  Hales' patience snapped for good  In Herath's second over  he skipped down the track and failed to reach the pitch of the ball with an ambitious wallop over the covers  A fast flat leading edge fizzed out to Dushmantha Chameera at deep extra cover  who pouched the offering with a well judged dive Hales was visibly distraught  lingering at the crease for several seconds and looking as though he wanted to snap his errant bat in two  Though he belatedly acknowledged the crowd as he dragged himself from the field  he knew that he had thrown away a priceless opportunity to silence those who doubt his credentials as a Test match opener It could have set his summer up at the first opportunity  Instead  having added 15 runs to his overnight 71 in 52 deliveries  with a dropped catch thrown in the mix as well  he will know that the jury remains out  At least  for those of a superstitious bent  he had guaranteed his fate would be different to the last two England openers to make a maiden Test hundred at Headingley   both Sam Robson  2014  and Adam Lyth  2015  were out of the side by the end of the summer If Hales' failing had been to linger too long  then a different criticism could be levelled at Moeen Ali  England's No  8 had admitted before the match that he had lost a bit of confidence in being slated to come in so low for his country  but the hasty manner in which he came and went didn't exactly enhance his case for a promotion  He had failed to score from his first seven deliveries when he drove too firmly at his eighth  from Dushmantha Chameera  and lobbed a simple catch off the inside edge and pad  to Kusal Mendis under the helmet at short leg It was a timely reward for the slippery Chameera  bowling only his second over of the day  He had erred on the short side in his fruitless first day's work  but was soon celebrating two wickets in the space of five deliveries when Stuart Broad drove flat footedly at a hint of width outside off and spread eagled his own stumps via an inside edge Bairstow simply stared down the track  rather nonplussed by the clatter of wickets in his midst  But he didn't have to wait long to reframe the story of the session  From the first ball of Chameera's next over  Bairstow drilled a drive into the covers  paused as a wild shy came in at the non striker's end  then galloped through with glee as the ball zipped through for overthrows to gift him his second century and his first on home soil  Coming at the ground where his late father  David  played for so many years  it was a moment that he may yet cherish even more than his emotional first century  at Cape Town five months ago 
England and Wales Cricket Board  EWCB  director Andrew Strauss has announced that a points system crossing all formats will be used for the matches against Sri Lanka and Pakistan this summer The Super Series will get underway when the international summer begins with the first Test between England and Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday As is traditional individual series trophies will still be atstake for the Tests oneday internationals and oneoff Twenty20internationals against both tourists But a system will also be introduced whereby the sides can earn four points for a Test win  two for a draw and two for a victory in one of the whiteball matches www skysports com reported An overall win may therefore possibly not be achieved until the final match in each series which will be the Twenty20 matches in the case of this summers tours and an unsponsored prize of 25 000 will be put up by the home board  The idea is Strauss own and he outlined the thinking behind it at Headingley on Wednesday Today Im introducing the Super Series the winner of which will be the overall tour winner for the Sri Lanka and Pakistan series over all formats  said the former England captain The rationale is that the game of cricket is evolving unbelievably quickly and I think we feel responsibility to ensure the international game develops  Central to that is context and relevance for every game of cricket you play  We believe the Super Series will provide that by connecting the formats and ensuring every game counts for something more than just itself Two separate whiteball teams and a redball team will be connected by something greater than their own immediate interests  What this doesnt do is replace any of the individual series awards this summer so there will still be a Test series victory plus the one day series and the Twenty20 match as well  But it sits on top of that wraps around it and creates something bigger to aim for The ECB is very keen to be at the fore front of efforts to modernise the international game and we feel this is a good way of ensuring the game remains relevant in both fans and players minds If the same points formula had been applied to Englands winter tours  the outcome would have been decided in the last match and the Test series winners would have been pipped at the line  Of course we would love the final game to be a Super Series decider that would be perfect  said Strauss If you look at the last two series we played  against South Africa we would have lost the Super Series in the final Twenty20 and against Pakistan in the UAE we would have won the Super Series in the super over in the final Twenty20  Anyone out there who doesnt see the need for international cricket to keep moving forwards really does have their head stuck in the sand I think we have to be on the front foot on this and say look we have a very vibrant Test support in this country and weve seen some fantastic Test matches over the last 12 18 months but there are some worrying signs there  so lets act before its too late

Manchester United substitute Jesse Lingard's superb volley in extra time secured a 2 1 win over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium on Saturday for their first major trophy in three years However  their Dutch manager Louis van Gaal was left wondering whether it would be enough to preserve his job two seasons into a three year contract amid British media reports that Jose Mourinho would be offered the job next week The game was locked at 1 1 after 90 minutes  Jason Puncheon coming off the bench to put London side Palace ahead 12 minutes from time before Juan Mata equalised three minutes later United central defender Chris Smalling was sent off in the extra period for a second yellow card but Lingard's moment of class gave them the Cup for the first time since 2004  It's fantastic to win this title for the club  the fans and also for me   Van Gaal said   Now I have won a Cup in four countries  Not many managers can say that so I am very happy  I don't want to talk about leaving the club  BRILLIANT RUNUnderdogs Palace took the lead when Puncheon  who had only come on six minutes earlier  deftly controlled a long ball into the area and fired past United goalkeeper David de Gea But within three minutes Wayne Rooney went on a brilliant run across the edge of the Palace area and crossed for Marouane Fellaini to set up the equaliser for Spaniard Mata Despite playing the second period of extra time with 10 men after Smalling's dismissal  United poured forward and Lingard's goal secured a 12th FA Cup triumph  equalling Arsenal's record  I saw it come across and it landed nicely for me  all I had to do was hit it sweet and luckily I did that  As a sub you always have to be ready  Thankfully I was   Lingard said Van Gaal  who arrived for his news conference carrying the trophy  added   It was a super goal when we needed it  It was unbelievable that we had injuries again but in spite of going down to 10 players we showed the spirit we have shown on the road to the final  Palace manager Alan Pardew  who played when the London club lost the replayed 1990 final against United  was frustrated by two refereeing decisions from Mark Clattenburg  who will be in charge of next weekend's Champions League final He felt Wilfried Zaha should have had a penalty when tackled by Rooney and that play should have been waved on as Connor Wickham recovered from Smalling's challenge and scored  It was a great cup final and could have gone either way   Pardew told reporters UNITED DANGEROUSPalace did not get quite enough from speedy winger Zaha  who United once bought for 15 million pounds  $21 76 million  before selling him back to their opponents  and Yannick Bolasie The London side threatened mainly from set pieces  although the tall Fellaini was a valuable asset in defending them United made the more dangerous chances throughout the game  hitting the post twice early in the second half through Fellaini and young French striker Anthony Martial Rooney was an influential captain in his deeper midfield role and 18 year old Marcus Rashford made several of their best opportunities  but had to go off injured in the 72nd minute Van Gaal could not say how serious the injury was or whether it would prevent Rashford joining the England squad next week It was the second time United had won the FA Cup after having a player sent off  Irish defender Kevin Moran was the first man dismissed in a final  when they beat Everton in 1985  Smalling was the fourth and the first Englishman There was a bonus in Palace's defeat for West Ham United  who will join United in the Europa League next season after the east London side move into their new Olympic Stadium ground

Australia captain Steven Smith has no qualms about playing another day night test at Adelaide Oval but is wary of how the pink ball will perform in the humid conditions expected at Brisbane later this year Australia plays Pakistan in the first test under lights at the Gabba on Dec  15  despite warnings from former players and pundits that muggy conditions could make the ball unplayable for batsmen In the inaugural day night match against New Zealand in drier Adelaide conditions last year  the ball hooped around menacingly during the floodlit late sessions and Australia won in three days Cricket Australia  CA  hope to schedule another test against South Africa at Adelaide Oval in November but the Proteas have balked at the prospect  citing a lack of experience with the pink ball  I think it worked well  the one test at the Adelaide Oval   Smith told reporters in Brisbane on Monday  I personally believe that's the best place to play a day night test match but we've got the one at the Gabba this year so it will be interesting to see how that goes GRASSY SURFACE It's just a little bit different with the ball and humidity that quite often is around in Brisbane  so it could be very difficult for the batters  particularly if there's grass left on the wicket  Fears that the pink ball might not last the required 80 overs in test cricket saw a grassy pitch prepared for the Adelaide match  making the task much harder for batsmen  I think we still need plenty of development with the ball to make sure that we don't prepare a wicket that suits the ball with plenty of grass on it   Smith added South Africa captain AB de Villiers said last month that his team had misgivings about playing the day night test after getting feedback from Smith and some other Australian players Although Smith responded by backing Cricket Australia's campaign for the Adelaide match  he was less enthused about playing a personal role in talking South Africa around  I guess we could have conversations about it with some of the senior players in South Africa but in the end it's up to both boards what they want to do in regards to the game   he said Smith will lead the one day team in a triangular tournament in the Caribbean against West Indies and South Africa next month and said he had recovered from a wrist injury that ended his stint in the Indian Premier League  IPL  prematurely

Manchester United sacked manager Louis van Gaal on Monday after an FA Cup triumph failed to make up for the club's inability to qualify for the Champions League amid widespread discontent with a season of insipid performances The Dutchman was dismissed two days after United's win over Crystal Palace in the Wembley Cup final  their first trophy in three years  paving the way for the widely expected appointment of former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho as his successor News of Van Gaal's impending departure from the club leaked out minutes after Saturday's 2 1 extra time victory over Palace and  following relentless media speculation and a day of negotiations  it was confirmed by both sides on Monday evening  I'd like to thank Louis and his staff for their excellent work in the past two years culminating in winning a record equalling 12th FA Cup for the club   executive vice chairman Ed Woodward said in a statement on the website of the club owned by the American Glazer family  www manutd com   He has behaved with great professionalism and dignity throughout his time here  He leaves us with a legacy of having given several young players the confidence to show their ability on the highest stage  Van Gaal  though gushing in his appreciation of the chance to manage the club  was not so happy to be moving on  I am very disappointed to be unable to complete our intended three year plan   he said  It has been an honour to manage such a magnificent club as Manchester United FC  and in doing so  I have fulfilled a long held ambition  I have been privileged during my management career to have won 20 trophies but winning the FA Cup  which is steeped in so much history  will always be one of the most special achievements of my career  That success  however  could not gloss over a season in which United finished fifth in the standings  missing out on Champions League qualification  and where dull performances had the fans booing their own team even after victories DISGRUNTLED FANSAfter replacing David Moyes two years ago  Van Gaal got the team into the Champions League in his first season However  United's inability to produce the free flowing football that characterised Alex Ferguson's trophy laden reign eventually caused a rift throughout the club and in the stands For generations of fans brought up to expect high octane attacking football  Van Gaal's stultifying approach was hard to swallow  particularly when it did not work well  after he spent almost 300 million pounds  $434 34 million  on players This season's dire statistics  beyond the key one of fifth place  are a damning indictment of the Dutchman's tactics United scored 49 goals in 38 games  in contrast to their previous Premier League average of over 76 and fourth placed Manchester City's 71 They had the joint highest number of goalless draws in the division  while Opta noted that United's 430 shots on target was 15th in the 20 team league and they made more backward passes than any other side It was not just supporters who were disgruntled either A story in Monday's Guardian newspaper said squad members had talked among themselves about openly defying the Dutchman's rigid tactical directions  which allegedly included instructions to players not to take first time shots It also reported that the two most senior players  Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick  had raised concerns with Van Gaal about his post match  evaluation sessions  in which he publicly criticised players in front of their team matesWIDESPREAD DISSATISFACTIONWith such widespread dissatisfaction it easy to forget that the 64 year old former Ajax Amsterdam  Barcelona  Bayern Munich and Netherlands coach was seen as the safe option when he was hired by United in May 2014 following Moyes's sacking He got the club back in the Champions League with a fourth place finish but  despite heavy spending on the likes of Memphis Depay  Anthony Martial and Bastian Schweinsteiger  United stagnated after topping the table at the end of September French striker Martial apart  the new players struggled to justify their fees  and Van Gaal increasingly turned to talented youngsters such as Marcus Rashford  who has rapidly emerged from United's youth team to earn a place in the England squad By mid December United were out of the top four after successive defeats by promoted clubs Bournemouth and Norwich City and they exited the Champions League after finishing third in a modest group behind VfL Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven At home to Southampton United were booed off the pitch and in Denmark the supporters  already frustrated by finding their team playing in the Europa League  chanted obscenities about how bad Van Gaal's side were in a 2 1 loss to FC Midjytlland Despite recovering with a 5 1 win in the second leg  United then lost to Liverpool in the round of 16 A late challenge for fourth place  the Cup run and the fan pleasing introduction of the youngsters  bought Van Gaal time but in the bigger picture it was not enough to change the mood Hovering in the background since his sacking in December has been Mourinho  once the scourge of Old Trafford for Porto and Chelsea but now seemingly about to be welcomed with open arms The Portuguese is hardly a graduate of the swashbuckling school of football himself but his remarkable record of

Cristiano Ronaldo owes most of his fame and fortune to his exploits with Real Madrid  yet he also remains a hugely influential figure when representing his country Portugal's results have improved enormously since Ronaldo made his international debut against Kazakhstan as an 18 year old in 2003 Their recent record at major tournaments is the envy of many bigger countries after they reached the Euro 2004 final  2006 World Cup semi finals and the Euro 2012 semi finals  where they lost to eventual winners Spain in a shootout Portugal have suffered when Ronaldo  who has captained them since he was 22  has been off form such as at the last World Cup when he suffered a bout of tendinosis in his left knee in the run up to the competition The Madeira born forward  who makes a point of breaking records  is Portugal's all time leading scorer with 56 goals in 125 appearances and needs three more caps to beat Luis Figo's record Nevertheless  the three time world player of the year has not been above criticism  with most of his goals coming in qualifying matches against weaker opponents and many supporters wondering why he did not take a penalty in the 2012 shootout against Spain It is  though  hard to imagine Portugal without him and Ronaldo himself says he wants to play for his country until at least the 2018 World Cup and maybe beyond  I don't make plans in my sporting life   he said in February   If I feel good in three years' time  we will see what happens  
English football's biggest club seem to have secured the services of the sport's most colourful manager after Jose Mourinho  according to Sky TV reports  agreed personal terms with Manchester United on Tuesday After a trophy laden career with Porto  Chelsea  Inter Milan and Real Madrid  Mourinho is set to replace Dutchman Louis van Gaal  who was sacked on Monday  with a remit to bring back the glory days the club once took for granted under Alex Ferguson The 53 year old  sacked by Chelsea in December seven months after winning his third Premier League title at the London club over two spells  had been constantly linked with the United job as Van Gaal struggled to make an impression at Old Trafford The Dutchman was dismissed two days after steering United to their first FA Cup success in 12 years when they beat Crystal Palace 2 1 after extra time in Saturday's Wembley final Van Gaal's preferred possession dominated playing style at a club more readily associated with fast  direct attacking  was widely criticised  and it appeared to take his players time to adapt Mourinho is also known for pragmatism  however  relying on a strong defensive foundation and hard working midfielders and strikers He has a history of success wherever he has managed and a proven track record in the English game Mourinho won the UEFA Cup and Champions League as well as the domestic double twice in his two seasons at Porto and led Chelsea to their first top flight title in 50 years in his first campaign  retaining it the following season He also won the League Cup and FA Cup before moving to Inter where he won Serie A as well as the Champions League and Italian Cup Mourinho helped Real to their first La Liga crown in four years and on returning to Chelsea  he again won the Premier League before an unexpectedly poor    and troubled    start to the 2015 16 season led to his sacking DIVIDED OPINIONHis imminent appointment at Old Trafford  touted in the media for months  will divide opinion but while some have voiced concern over playing style and potentially explosive personality clashes  he is widely considered to be as close to a guarantee of silverware as a manager can be The challenge will be not only to deliver success but to do it in style Van Gaal's FA Cup triumph was not enough to allow him to see out the final year of his contract on the back of a season in which the club's fans routinely voiced their frustration with the safety first football being served up Mourinho is not known for throwing caution to the wind but fans will hope that under his leadership United will at least not again be ranked top in the Premier League for the number of backwards passes made as they were under Van Gaal There will also be pressure for the new man to continue the good work of his predecessor in bringing young players such as Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard to the fore  something else Mourinho has singularly failed to do at most of his previous clubs However  after three seasons without a league title and with no Champions League football for a second time in three years  the United hierarchy are evidently prepared to accept potential downsides if the 'Special One' gets the club back to what they consider to be their rightful place at the sport's top table Former Old Trafford goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel believes the Portuguese  could save  the club while Hull City manager Steve Bruce  who used to play in front of the Dane in central defence  said the chance to bring in Mourinho was  too good to miss  Former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti  who will coach Bayern Munich next season  said Mourinho would be a  fantastic signing   adding United had  lost its identity this last year  Former Old Trafford great Eric Cantona  however  said his old team should have gone for incoming Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola instead  saying he  loved  Mourinho but that his style of play is  not Manchester United  Retired Dutch international Ronald de Boer believes Mourinho is  similar  to Van Gaal in being a  workaholic  who  prepares perfectly on how to win  De Boer  who worked with Van Gaal at Ajax Amsterdam and with both men at Barcelona  said of Mourinho   Sometimes it is not pretty but he knows how to grind out wins  That is what you get

The final of the Indian Premier League was indeed a nail biting contest as Virat Kohli's Challengers fell short of chasing the 209 run target set by Warner's Sunrisers While Gayle and Virat Kohli did add fire to the run chase earlier on with his 54 run knock as Gayle also chipped in with 76 runs  it fell short of the Sunriser's daunting total of 209  After Virat Kohli was dismissed and Gayle too  no other Challengers' batsman was able to stand tall as even the mighty Shane Watson fell cheaply for 18 runs Hence  the Royal Challengers Bangalore could not successfully chase the whole target and had to concede the title to the Sunrisers  This was the Sunriser's maiden IPL trophy as the team had lost out on the covetedcup in 2009 and 2011 as well img alt    height  255  src  http //apne thenews com pk/assets/front/tiny_mce/source/1 PNG  width  624 /img alt    height  253  src  http //apne thenews com pk/assets/front/tiny_mce/source/2 PNG  width  625 /
Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza lost their cool as their hopes of holding all four grand slam titles were dashed following a 6 3 6 2 defeat by Czech duo Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova in the third round of the French Open on Sunday The Indo Swiss team dubbed  Santina  were hoping to win four majors in a row after following up last year's Wimbledon and U S  Open triumphs with victory in January's Australian Open But the top seeds appeared all at sea on a gloomy day at Roland Garros and their bid to complete the 'Santina Slam' ended after the Czechs blasted a service return winner to break Hingis in the final game Hingis and Mirza were left fuming at the umpire after a call went against them as they trailed 4 1 in the second set  Mirza tossed the ball in anger but the duo failed to win the argument  or the match  leaving Krejcikova and Siniakova to celebrate a memorable victory It proved to be a bad day for the big names in doubles as Venus and Serena Williams  who were the last women's team to hold all four majors in 2010  also perished in the third round  beaten 6 3 6 3 by the Dutch Swedish pairing of Kiki Bertens and Johanna Larsson

Australia's search for a successor to Shane Warne is yet to bear fruit nearly a decade after he retired  so Adam Zampa is naturally wary about comparisons with the leg spinning great The 24 year old has been picked in Australia's squad for the triangular one day international tournament in the Caribbean and will battle off spinner Nathan Lyon and slow bowling all rounder Glenn Maxwell for a place against West Indies and South Africa Unheralded only a few months ago  Zampa first made his mark in the most unusual of circumstances when he 'ran out' a batsman with his nose when playing for Melbourne Stars in Australia's 'Big Bash' league A good performance in the that tournament led to a spot in Australia's World Twenty20 squad and after making his ODI debut against New Zealand in February  Zampa impressed in the Indian Premier League  IPL  at new franchise Rising Pune Supergiants His bowling action and run up have been compared to Warne's  which has further fuelled the hype  but the New South Welshman says that is where the similarities end  There's only ever going to be one Shane Warne   Zampa told Australian media  The attributes he had  how strong he was  his leg spinner was unbelievable and to be able to bowl that leg spinner for as long as he did for five days for his whole career was something unbelievable  People do look at me and think I look a lot like him but I think the only thing that would be similar is the smoother run up  It's a nice comparison but I don't really think about it that way  FAILED EXPERIMENTSSince Warne's retirement after the final Ashes test against England in 2007  Australian selectors have barely flirted with leg spin Victorian Bryce McGain lasted one test in 2009  promptly discarded after going wicketless for 149 runs against South Africa in Cape Town Early in his career  incumbent captain Steve Smith was picked as a leg spinning all rounder against England in the 2010 11 series but later shelved his bowling to concentrate on becoming an elite batsman Left arm wrist spinner Beau Casson briefly stepped into the spotlight when he was selected for a match against West Indies on the 2008 tour but duly fell into a form rut and was never looked at again Lyon has since cemented himself as Australia's premier slow bowler and Zampa missed out on a place in the test squad to tour Sri Lanka in July and August Zampa  however  hopes to impress ahead of next year's tour of India  where he has shown his comfort with South Asian pitches  The white ball at the moment is probably something I'm concentrating on but if I keep improving  I feel like it doesn't matter what format you're playing   he said Australia play the first ODI against West Indies in Providence  Guyana on June 5

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho will not stoke his rivalry with fellow new recruit Pep Guardiola at Manchester City next season because it could damage his team's Premier League title hopes  he said on Tuesday Mourinho and Guardiola had a fractious relationship when the Portuguese was in charge of Real Madrid and the Spaniard was at the helm at Barcelona during the 2010 11 and 2011 12 seasons  My experience does not allow me to be naive  What I mean by that is that I was with Pep for two years in a championship where the champion was either him or me  Real Madrid or Barcelona   Mourinho told an event at the Faculty of Human Kinetics in Lisbon  In a situation like that individual battles make sense because they can have an influence  If  in the English Premier League  I focus on him at Manchester City and he on me at Manchester United  another team will win the title  The new United and City managers face an early confrontation when their sides meet in a friendly in Beijing on July 25 Mourinho  who replaced the sacked Louis van Gaal  and Guardiola  who is taking over from Manuel Pellegrini  will renew hostilities in the pre season International Champions Cup United will be trying next term to make up ground on their neighbours who have finished above them in the Premier League for the past three campaigns since manager Alex Ferguson stood down Last season City were ahead on goal difference but pipping United to fourth position meant they took the final Champions League qualifying place  leaving the Old Trafford club to settle for a spot in the Europa League Mourinho said he could not afford to focus on Guardiola if he wanted to bring the title back to United for the first time since 2013  Look at the Bundesliga     in the last five years the same team won the title four times and in France the same team won the last four   he said  In Spain Atletico  Madrid  won once and Barcelona the other three  In England there have been four different champions in the last four years  That says a lot about the competitiveness  The fact it has the biggest television rights and that the television revenues are distributed in the way that they are  allows the league to grow as a competition whereas  in the other leagues  the sharks are always the sharks   added Mourinho

Novak Djokovic had 100 million reasons to celebrate reaching the French Open quarter finals on Wednesday    albeit two days later than expected    as players finally cleared the fourth round backlog created by the fickle Parisian weather After relentless rain washed out all but two hours of play over the previous two days  under fire Roland Garros organisers said such conditions had not been seen since 1873 as they frantically tried to play catch up by staging 12 singles matches    instead of just four quarter finals as is the norm    on day 11 of the sodden championships That allowed world number one Djokovic to become the first tennis player to bank $100 million in prize money after his 3 6 6 4 6 1 7 5 win over Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut tipped him over the magic number Having won a match that was originally scheduled for Monday  begun on Tuesday and completed on Wednesday  the 29 year old Serb will have to play four days in succession if he is to reach Sunday's title showdown  I have the feeling I played three matches against him   a grinning Djokovic told the crowd after donning a yellow rain hat during his victory speech  Yesterday the match was interrupted three times and it wasn't easy coming here at 9 am and leaving at 7 30 or 8 00 pm  So that's the reason why we should have the roof here   added the Serb  who joined the likes of golfer Tiger Woods and boxer Lennox Lewis in the $100 million club However  rather than getting worked up about the French Open not having any court cover like the other three majors  it was the organisers' decision to make the players compete in misty rain on Tuesday that overshadowed Wednesday's on court action Serena Williams  who like Djokovic was bogged down in the fourth round for more than 48 hours  booked her place in the quarter finals by walloping Ukrainian 18th seed Elina Svitolina 6 1 6 1  She will next face Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva In the bottom half of the men's draw  Andy Murray doused some early fireworks from Frenchman Richard Gasquet to win 5 7 7 6 3  6 0 6 2 to set up a blockbuster semi final against holder Stan Wawrinka  The Swiss beat Albert Ramos  Spain  6 2 6 1 7 6 7  RAIN PLAY STILL A HOT TOPICBut the hot topic of the day remained what the organisers did  or did not do  on Tuesday Djokovic's victim Bautista Agut said officials had  pushed us to play two hours yesterday     the threshold needed to avoid reimbursing money to ticket holders    while Venus Williams labelled the conditions  really bad  after being ambushed 6 2 6 4 by Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky  The conditions were not playable yesterday  It's hard to see  The balls are wet  the courts are wet   said the American  whose defeat ended hopes of an all Williams semi final French Open director Guy Forget defended the tournament's actions  I understand that not refunding spectators      has caused frustration and anger   he said  If what we are being accused of were true  it would have been in our best interests to stop play before the one hour  59 minute mark as our insurer would have been responsible for ticket reimbursement  However    our aim was to play for as long as possible  even if that meant being criticised for playing in difficult conditions  Djokovic will be hoping he does not face another soggy day on Thursday when he is scheduled to contest his 28th successive major quarter final against Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych  a 6 3 7 5 6 3 winner over 2013 runner up David Ferrer Austrian tyro Dominic Thiem was enjoying his most successful run at a grand slam after beating Spaniard Marcel Granollers 6 2 6 7 2  6 1 6 4 to set up a last eight clash with Belgian David Goffin Venus Williams' eighth seeded conqueror Bacsinszky  describing herself as  a chameleon  who can adapt to  every type of court   will next face Dutch outsider Kiki Bertens who downed American 15th seed Madison Keys 7 6 4  6 3 Already in the semi finals though are Spanish fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and 2011 U S  Open champion Sam Stosur Fourth seed Muguruza ended the run of 108th ranked American Shelby Rogers with a 7 5 6 3 win  while 2010 Paris finalist Stosur beat Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova 6 4 7 6 6  
The International Cricket Council  ICC  has admitted that it often tweaks the draws of major events to get Pakistan and India into the same group The draw for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England saw India and Pakistan being grouped together  with defending champions India beginning their title defence against their arch rivals at Edgbaston on June 4  No doubt  we try to put Pakistan versus India in our event   said ICC chief executive Dave Richardson  according to a report published in The Telegraph  It's hugely important from an ICC point of view  It's massive around the world and the fans have come to expect it as well  It's fantastic for the tournament because it gives it a massive kick  It is the fifth tournament in succession where Pakistan and India are scheduled to meet in the group stage  Matches between the two countries attract huge television audiences  sometimes up to one billion  It had long been suspected that the ICC was doctoring draws to guarantee fans and broadcasters regular opportunities to savour cricket's most lucrative fixture  but this is the first time that the governing body has admitted it publicly Richardson denied that the 'tweaking' impacted the integrity of any tournament   What we try and do is make sure that when you add up the rankings of the different groups  they all add up to the same number of points  You can do that in a number of ways  So long as the pools are balanced  it's silly to avoid [the fixture] when you can fairly cater for it   he said

World number ones Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams will feel like they are working overtime on Friday when organisers cram all four semi finals into a single session to try and ensure a rain ravaged tournament ends on schedule The Serbian will be on court for a fourth day running and the American for a third  after the players' usual rest days between matches were eaten up by persistent rain delays that washed out Monday and meant just two hours of play were possible on Tuesday The Serbian will also have to trade down to Roland Garros' number two court to battle past his young Austrian opponent  Dominic Thiem  The 13th seed has lost both their encounters but is strengthening his case with every win to be viewed as the pick of a new tennis generation  He's playing the best tennis of his life   Djokovic told a news conference on Thursday after dispatching Czech Tomas Berdych in straight sets  He's played a lot of matches  especially on clay  which is his favourite surface    I'm sure he's going to give it all in the semis  Weather permitting  all semi finals at grand slam tournaments are invariably played on the main showcourt  but the scheduling backlog means Djokovic and Thiem  and before them Spanish women's fourth seed Garbine Muguruza and Australian Sam Stosur  will play Friday's matches on Court Suzanne Lenglen Taking pride of place on Paris' main Philippe Chatrier showcourt will be Williams and unseeded Dutchwoman Kiki Bertens  followed by arguably the most mouthwatering clash of the day between world number two Andy Murray and defending champion Stan Wawrinka  I think he's been an amazing player for many  many years   Wawrinka told reporters about Murray  who has won eight of their 15 encounters  He always tries to be a better player  The way he's improved on clay is quite impressive  because now he's winning a lot of tournaments  Both the Swiss and the Briton have had the luxury of an extra day's rest  having completed their fourth round matches on Sunday before the rain set in But while Djokovic  who along with Thiem did not clear the fourth round until Wednesday  is keenly aware he has had less time to recharge his batteries  that may just make him concentrate all the harder  The way that the schedule has been going on in the second week means there is not much time to really reflect on what you have done   he said  My focus right away goes for recovery and the next match  
When Ramazan starts  Imran Tahir will begin juggling the demands of observing his Muslim faith and playing a full day of international cricket for a team sponsored by a beer company  I dont think it is difficult to balance professional sports with practising your faith   insisted the South Africa legspinner  in an interview with AFP  It is very easy if you follow the right path  One of the worlds top spinners  Pakistan born Tahir has played more than 100 times for the Proteas since making his international debut in 2011  after becoming a South African citizen through marriage In his native Pakistan  the team regularly prays together on the field during internationals and the lunch break is extended on Fridays  so players and fans can attend the weekly services at the nearest mosque And in Bangladesh  the only other Muslim majority Test playing nation  facilities have been set aside to enable fans to pray at the ground Tahir is one of five Muslims to have been selected for the South African squad taking part in the tri nation ODI series with the West Indies and Australia in the Caribbean that begins on Friday and runs until June 26   Lager logo  They include former skipper Hashim Amla  who along with Tahir has been given special dispensation not to sport the logo of Castle lager  the teams major sponsor  as Muslims are forbidden from drinking alcohol Muslims are normally expected to fast from dawn to dusk during the month of Ramadan  which begins in different parts of the world this coming Sunday or Monday But they are allowed to refrain from fasting if they are away from home  as in the case of Tahir while he is in the West Indies Tahir said that even if he did not observe a fast on a particular match day  he would still make it up at a later stage  I am thankful to Allah that he drove me closer to him   Tahir said  during the just finished Indian Premier League  I try not to miss my prayers and the 30 fasts in Ramadan but even if I do miss them due to my cricket  I make up for them later on  The Lahore born Tahir has plied his trade around the world  including stints in Englands county championship and the IPL  where he played for the Delhi Daredevils Speaking to AFP in the Indian capital  Tahir said that many in the cricketing fraternity helped him observe his faith  I have come through all the different cultures of the world while playing cricket and I have had no difficulty whatsoever while following my path   he said  glancing at the clock to ensure he wouldnt be late for Friday prayers  Rather they  players  coaches and support staff  give more respect  Some have even offered me their room to offer my Namaz  prayers     Late starter  Since making his international debut at the late age of 32  Tahir has become a mainstay of a South African team that had long lacked a top class spinner He has particularly excelled in the shorter formats and is now the worlds number two bowler in Twenty20 internationals behind the West Indian spinner Samuel Badree  and number six in the ODI chart His animated celebrations and appeals have made him something of a pantomime villain among some fans  but Tahir says it shows his passion  I think people know that the celebration is instinctive and not fake   he said  Looking back at the hard patches of my life  I feel good that I have come thus far  If I get a wicket I just want to show people that how big that is for me

Serena Williams vowed to keep chasing down Steffi Grafs record of 22 Grand Slam titles after it remained once again tantalisingly out of reach thanks to Garbine Muguruzas French Open triumph on Saturday Williamss titles count at the majors has stalled on 21 ever since she lifted a sixth Wimbledon crown last year by beating Muguruza in the final The American star then suffered a shock semi final loss to Italian journeywoman Roberta Vinci at the US Open before defeat to Germanys Angelique Kerber in the Australian Open title match in January Saturdays 7 5  6 4 loss to Muguruza  12 years her junior  was the first time in her storied career that she had lost two successive Grand Slam finals Muguruza  interestingly  is only the second player born in the 1990s    after Petra Kvitova    to win a Grand Slam <br/> The only thing I can do is just keep trying   said Williams who was attempting to win a fourth French Open after 2002  2013 and 2015  In Australia  Ann Kerber made 16 errors in three sets  you know  so what do you do in that situation  Today Garbine played unbelievable  Its definitely something I want to dissect and see what I can learn from that and what can I do to get better from it  <br/>Williams had struggled with an adductor injury at Roland Garros  a condition not helped by the unseasonal chill and damp Despite that  she still finished top of the pile for aces served at 36 and sent down the joint fastest serve of the event at 196km/h in Saturdays final But she had one of the lowest first serve percentage rates at 60% and managed to convert only 30 of 73 break points over the two weeks The final  she suggested  was a reflection of her tournament as a whole  It was just so many holes  Like I could have served better  I mean  I made a lot of errors on my return  I did definitely try out there today  but did I play better than the other matches  Its a totally different game  But its going in the right direction  I think  Williams believes Muguruza  the first Spanish woman since Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in 1998 to win a Grand Slam  has the game to build further on her Roland Garros breakthrough  I think she has a bright future  obviously  She knows how to play on the big stage and she clearly knows how to win Grand Slams   said the American of a player who was just eight when she won her first Paris title  Shes definitely hitting hard  She just goes for broke on every shot and it works for her

For Bob Arum  the famed promoter who befriended Muhammad Ali some 50 years ago  the former heavyweight champions legacy in the boxing ring pales in comparison to his impact on America and the world Arum told Reuters on Saturday  the day after Ali died in a Phoenix area hospital at the age of 74  that his long time friend should be remembered for standing up against racism and war at a time when doing so was risky and unpopular  I think when you talk about Muhammad Ali  as great an athlete  as great a boxer as he was  he was the greatest boxer of all time  he means so much more to the United States and the world   Arum said  He was a transformative figure in our society   Arum  84  recalled that Ali strode onto the world stage in the mid 1960s  at a time when African Americans were still fighting for basic civil rights  And while Martin Luther King was talking sense and talking about progress that could be made in his soft spoken way  Ali  with his big mouth was thundering and demanding rights for African American people and standing up for what was right   Arum said  At first that didnt sit well with the people in the United States  At fights he was booed because they felt that he was too outspoken   he said Arum said he disagreed at the time with Alis refusal to be drafted into the U S  Army and fight in Vietnam  a stand that cost the fighter his world boxing crown  And I said hell no  I advised him just the opposite   Arum said   But of course he wouldnt listen He did what he thought was right And it turned out he was right  and I was wrong   The promoter said Ali gave up three years in the prime of his career to stand up for those convictions and was ultimately vindicated in the public eye  So when I look back at his life  and I was blessed to call him a friend and spent a lot of time with him  its hard for me to talk about his exploits in boxing because as great as they were they paled in comparison to the impact that he had on the world   Arum said

For Andy Murray  reaching Sunday's French Open final was a bonus  but he was in no mood to look for silver linings in the aftermath of yet another grand slam reverse at the hands of Novak Djokovic The second seeded Briton's 3 6 6 1 6 2 6 4 defeat on Court Philippe Chatrier was his fifth loss in seven blue riband finals against the Serbian world number one  and his eighth out of 10 finals in all  I was struggling  I was a couple of points from going out of the tournament in the first round   he told reporters  But then when you get there  to the final  obviously you want to win  You know  I didn't do that today  Right now I'm very disappointed  Had he turned the tables on a player he has beaten just twice in the past 14 meetings  Murray would have become the first British man to win the French Open since Fred Perry in 1935 The last of those rare Murray victories came in May's Italian Open final  also played on clay    a surface the Scot once mistrusted but now looks increasingly at ease on    and in the same damp conditions that dominated this year's Roland Garros fortnight Facing a Paris crowd heavily favouring his opponent in a stadium dotted on all sides with Serbian flags  the Scot managed to carry that momentum into the early part of Sunday's match    one he said after his semi final win over Stan Wawrinka that he had  never expected to reach  Murray won 16 of 20 points at one stage of the first set But after failing to convert a break point in the first game of the second set  Murray lost the initiative and Djokovic kicked into a higher gear The Serbian faltered only at the sharp end of the match  nervously dropping serve at 5 2 as the prospect of winning his fourth major in a row began to sink in  but sealing the match two games later GRACIOUS AND WITTYWhen it was all over  Murray crossed the net to embrace his rival  well aware of the immensity of an achievement he paid tribute to in a gracious  witty courtside speech  Winning all four of the grand slams in one year is an amazing achievement  This is something that is so rare in tennis   he said     So everyone here who came to watch is obviously extremely lucky to see it  Me personally being on the opposite side  it sucks to lose the match  But I am proud to have been part of today  Murray acknowledged that same sense of perspective might help him view his achievements in a kinder light at the end of his career  having shared top four billing over many years with Djokovic and two other all time greats of the game in Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal  Federer missed this year's tournament with a back problem and Nadal had to pull out with a wrist injury after the second round  Obviously the guys I have been around the last few years have made things difficult for me   he said  But I guess I've got a few more years to try and  win more slams   I think when I finish I will be more proud of my achievements maybe  Meanwhile next month's Wimbledon beckons  and another chance to set the record straight    this time on a surface on which the Serbian has never beaten him

NEW YORK/The death of boxing great Muhammad Ali cost American Muslims perhaps their greatest hero  a goodwill ambassador for Islam in a country where their minority faith is widely misunderstand and mistrusted  We thank God for him   Talib Shareef  president and imam of the Masjid Muhammad mosque in Washington  told a gathering of Muslim leaders who honored Ali in Washington on Saturday  a day after he died in a Phoenix hospital at age 74   America should thank God for him  He was an American hero  From the turmoil of civil rights and black Muslim movements of the 1960s to the darkest days after Sept  11  2001  Ali was a hero that U S  Muslims could share with part of the American mainstream Muslims remembered Ali for many familiar reasons  hailing him as a champion of social justice  a lifelong supporter of charitable works and an opponent of the U S  war in Vietnam Moreover  they said  he was a Muslim that a largely Christian country came to admire  even if Ali shocked and scared much of U S  society after he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay in 1964  When we look at the history of the African American community  one important factor in popularizing Islam in America is Muhammad Ali   Warith Deen Mohammed II  son of the former Nation of Islam leader  said in a statement With some 3 3 million adherents in the United States  Muslims make up about 1 percent of the population  largely immigrants and African Americans who have embraced the religion Although they have integrated into society better than some of their brethren in Europe  American Muslims face hardships even as the United State grows demographically less white and less Christian Since 2001  they have suffered backlash from those Americans who equate all Muslims with those who have attacked civilians out of some jihadist cause Decades before  black Muslim leaders such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X rattled the white establishment as religious and ethnic minorities who demanded equality for their people  Elijah Mohammad preached a version that denounced white oppression and opposed integration of the races Ali came to be widely revered  but there was a time when he was rejected  mostly by whites by also by some black leaders for his bold statements against white supremacy and for his refusal to embrace the model epitomized by Martin Luther King  a Christian  The sanitizing of Ali's image in recent years has led many to forget that he was reviled by many during the 1960s for his conversion to Islam and for his refusal to be inducted into the U S  armed forces   said Frank Guridy  a visiting associate professor of history at Columbia University  He was seen as a traitor to the United States of America  In the 1970s  Ali converted to Sunni Islam  the largest denomination among Muslims worldwide  and embraced Sufism  a mystical school of the faith At the gathering of Muslim American leaders in Washington  speaker after speaker remembered him fondly as the Muslim who Americans came to love Ali defended Muslims last December  after Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump proposed temporarily stopping Muslims from entering the country in the wake of militant attacks in Paris and San Bernardino  California  Our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam  and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is   Ali said in a statement He also used his influence to advocate the release of Jason Rezaian  a Washington Post reporter who spent 18 months in a Iranian prison  and for Daniel Pearl  a Wall Street Journal reporter who was captured by extremists in Pakistan and later beheaded in 2002  Muhammad Ali was a gift from God   said Nihad Awad  executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations   not only to Muslims but to the world

Stuart Broad has insisted he wont have any issues playing against Mohammad Amir should the convicted spot fixer make his Test return at Lords next month Lords was the venue six years ago when left arm quick bowler Amir and two Pakistan team mates were involved in the deliberate bowling of no balls as part of a newspaper sting operation to demonstrate the trios willingness to take part in spot fixing A teenager at the time and one of world crickets undoubted rising stars  Amir was sent to jail by an English court and banned from all cricket worldwide for five years He has now served that ban and  unlike 2010 Pakistan captain Salman Butt and fellow paceman Mohammad Asif  Amir has now been included in the squad for a four Test series starting at Lords on July 14 Team officials are optimistic the 24 year old will receive his British visa in the next couple of days following a special request for leniency from the Pakistan Cricket Board The 2010 match  which England won by an innings  is now best remembered for the spot fixing controversy rather than Broads impressive 169  his lone Test hundred  could rankle with the England fast medium bowler But Broad  speaking at an event organised by England sponsor Hardys wine on Monday  said   I dont think any feelings will be dragged into this Test match from that one  There are only four players in  this  England team from then  and Pakistan had a huge change over  So I dont think any ill feeling or negativity from the players will have carried through  Turning to Amirs possible return  Broad said   I think hes served his time  For quality of bowler  I dont think there is much doubt that he is up there with anyone  Ive not played him for six years  but in 2010 he was a constant threat and man of the series  It swung round corners for him  However  citing the reaction of spectators at Lords to England all rounder Ben Stokes controversial dismissal for obstructing the field in a one day international against Australia last year  Broad said spectators at the home of cricket may not welcome Amir back with open arms  The crowd might be a different story  There was a lively reaction to Ben Stokes dismissal last year to Mitchell Starc  and it looked like a nasty atmosphere for a while  Result devaluedAs for his 2010 hundred  which surpassed the highest Test score achieved by his father Chris  a former England opening batsman  Broad does not feel it was tainted by the spot fixing furore  I do look back at it  and Im very proud of scoring a hundred at Lords  and beating my dads highest score   Its certainly not devalued in my mind  I still scored those runs and  Im  still on the honours board  Nevertheless  he added   I think the result was devalued  We couldnt celebrate  we didnt celebrate  it was all a very strange time  The one day series that followed was quite unpleasant  and the crowds reflected the bad feeling  The ongoing England Sri Lanka series has seen Broad displaced as the worlds top ranked Test bowler by new ball colleague James Anderson Andersons 18 wickets in the opening two matches have been central to England going 2 0 up in a three match series ahead of this weeks third Test against Sri Lanka at Lords starting on Thursday  Its a lovely accolade for our partnership that weve both managed to climb up the rankings like that   said Broad  who has now dropped down to third place in the standings  Its great to have a little bit of competition  and we are both really competitive guys

Cricket South Africa  CSA  have overcome their initial hesitancy and confirmed on Wednesday that the third and final test of the tour of Australia will be a day night fixture at Adelaide Oval starting on Nov  24 The Proteas had been reluctant to be involved in a day night match having never played with a pink ball but with two warm up matches under lights planned for the October November tour  CSA said they were now willing to play the fixture  Following careful consideration and engagement with all our test players  and acknowledging the need to exploit the potential of playing day night test match cricket  I am pleased to announce that we have agreed with Cricket Australia to proceed with this fixture   CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement on Wednesday  Our Proteas were initially hesitant to play such a key test match without previous experience and adequate preparation but after working through all their concerns and the possible options to prepare sufficiently  there is new found excitement for this novel test match  South Africa captain AB de Villiers added that the major concern for the players was having adequate preparation with a pink ball  We were never against this exciting concept but only wanted to give ourselves the best opportunity of competing in conditions that will be new and foreign to us   he said  Two warm up matches will hopefully give us an idea of what to expect and hopefully our preparations will help us to adapt accordingly  This will be the first time that our players in the test squad will play pink ball test match cricket in front of such a large crowd and to be part of this novel concept will no doubt be a landmark moment in all of our careers  The first day night test was played between Australia and New Zealand in Adelaide last year and drew 124 000 spectators despite only lasting three days The highest score in all four innings was 224  with Australia winning by three wickets 
For someone who has spent six agonising months on the sidelines battling doping allegations  Sri Lankan Kusal Perera cannot think of a better place for his return than the hallowed turf of Lords in the third and final test against England on Thursday The 25 year old wicketkeeper batsman was sent home from the tour of New Zealand in December after it was announced he had failed a drugs test last July He was cleared last month when the International Cricket Council  ICC  dropped all charges against him after the Qatar based laboratory that conducted the test withdrew its initial findings Perera was not allowed to train with Sri Lanka Cricket  SLC  coaches and was called up in England only after a shoulder injury had ended paceman Dhammika Prasads tour  I havent been told if Im playing yet but I was thrown into trouble and to come back from that at Lords would be a great opportunity   Kusal told reporters at Lords after practice on Tuesday  I was banned just before a test  so to return in this format would be fitting Even the time I was out of the team I knew I hadnt done anything wrong But these things can happen in life  Perera  who has played three tests and 51 one dayers  admitted he arrived in England undercooked  having barely trained before a series he did not expect to be involved in  I didnt have any time to think about whether I was in touch  or whether I could train  or even what was happening in cricket  I started training the day after I was cleared Before then I didnt do much batting    just some fitness work  Perera  however  felt he was fresh and striking the ball well  which might help his team salvage some pride after batting collapses in Leeds and Chester le Street helped the hosts open an unassailable 2 0 series lead  I watched the attack and its mostly fast bowlers   he said of Englands bowlers  In London  the conditions seem easier  because it must have been very cold in Durham  When its cold you are a bit stiff and your feet dont work as well With this weather and given the pitch as well    which looks like it will be batting friendly    I think theres a chance for us to dominate them

PROVIDENCE  GUYANA  South Africa roared back into contention in the Tri Nation One Day International series with a 47 run victory over Australia in the third match of the tournament at the Guyana National Stadium on Tuesday Defending a modest 189 for nine on another pitch that challenged the patience and technique of all batsmen  the Proteas bowlers were resisted only by opener Aaron Finchs defiant 72 before he was ninth out as the World Cup holders folded for 142 off 34 2 overs By virtue of their margin of victory  South Africa also earned a bonus point and leapt from last to first on net run rate over Australia  leaving hosts West Indies third Competition resumes in St Kitts on Saturday with South Africa and Australia renewing their rivalry at Warner Park Farhaan Behardiens workmanlike innings of 62 held South Africas innings together and earned him the  Man of the Match  award  However pacer Kagiso Rabada shared the plaudits with a useful unbeaten 15 as the tail contributed important runs and then led the way with the ball as he claimed three for 13 off seven probing overs Rabada disposed of Usman Khawaja in his opening spell and returned to account for wicketkeeper batsman Matthew Wade and tailender Nathan Coulter Nile in an excellent display of controlled fast bowling  His effort was supported by Wayne Parnell  who shared the new ball and got rid of the dangerous David Warner in his very first over Playing his first ODI for almost 16 months  Parnell then trapped Australian captain Steve Smith leg before Spinners Imran Tahir and Aaron Phangiso then tightened the stranglehold with two wickets apiece  while Tabraiz Shamsi  the left arm leggie  marked his debut with the wicket of Glenn Maxwell in his first over to ensure there was no escape for the Aussies  We started well with the two seamers although this wasnt the kind of surface where they were having the time of their lives   captain A B  de Villiers said    Tabraiz  Shamsi was a handful for their batters  I didnt see a lot of them picking him    Tough games coming up  Earlier  Australias fast bowling pair of Coulter Nile and Josh Hazlewood proved most effective with two wickets each in restricting the Proteas after de Villiers surprisingly chose to bat first on winning the toss  We didnt adapt well enough with the bat today   was Smiths assessment of his teams reply   Weve got a couple of tough games ahead of us now and we have to improve on this effort  Coulter Nile  who replaced Mitchell Starc from the opening victory over West Indies two days earlier  made the most of the opportunity with a spell of two for 38 off 10 overs He claimed the vital wickets of de Villiers and J P  Duminy in consecutive overs to reduce the South Africans to 104 for five midway through the innings  effectively killing off any realistic chance they had of posting a formidable total Hazlewood was even more economical in conceding 20 runs off 10 metronomic overs  He earned an LBW verdict against Quinton de Kock to break the opening partnership with Hashim Amla and returned to get rid of Parnell South Africa entertained hopes of a challenging total when de Villiers and Amla were at the crease  The two most experienced batsmen in the side put on 40 for the third wicket before Amla was run out for the third time in ODIs against Australia Wickets continued to fall regularly thereafter and it was left to the lower order players Phangiso and Rabada to assist Behardien in lifting the South Africans closer to the 200 run mark

Spain are steadily turning to the next generation ahead of their Euro 2016 opener against the Czech Republic later on Monday as the defending champions look to redeem themselves after a miserable World Cup two years ago For Spain's disappointing showing in 2014  coach Vicente del Bosque retained 16 of the squad that won the title in 2010  but only eight winners remain for Euro 2016  with players such as Alvaro Morata  Hector Bellerin and Thiago Alcantara introduced as part of a significant changing of the guard Sergio Ramos is confident the new boys  five of whom were part of the 2013 European under 21 winning side  can lead Spain into a new golden era  People got used to us winning   he told reporters on Sunday   and maybe we did too  we didn't value our achievements  This team can shine at the same level as before  or almost as much  The players may have less experience  but they've integrated well  Morata  in particular  looks set to play a key role as the latest player to lead the line for del Bosque who has toyed with various striking options during his eight year tenure Top scorer David Villa started at the 2010 World Cup  Fernando Torres scored in the victorious finals of both Euro 2008 and 2012 while Diego Costa was added to the team in 2014 Alvaro Negredo  Fernando Llorente and Roberto Soldado were all given opportunities to prove that they could be the right man to adapt to Spain's distinctive playing style However  none of the aforementioned strikers have been included this time  with del Bosque naming Morata  Aritz Aduriz and Nolito  with Cesc Fabregas also an option to repeat his effective false nine role from Euro 2012  I think we had the best forwards in the country's history with Fernando  David and others   said Andres Iniesta   but now it's different  We have new players like Alvaro and Aritz  and there's Cesc   he continued   We have full confidence that they'll score goals at the critical moments  Del Bosque is delighted with the squad's blend and has warned people to expect something a little different from the team that will face the Czech Republic in Toulouse  If you consider some of my past teams  it's not the same now   the coach said   We have younger players and we have veterans  We have confidence in all of them

Lewis Hamilton would not have put money on his title fortunes turning around so quickly but the Mercedes driver could be back on top of the Formula One world championship as early as next weekend Victory in Sundays Canadian Grand Prix  following the Britons fortunate win in Monaco two weeks earlier  transformed his chances of ending the season with a fourth drivers crown From being 43 points behind German team mate Nico Rosberg two races ago  Hamilton heads for Azerbaijan and Sundays inaugural grand prix in Baku trailing by nine Rosberg won the opening four rounds of the season but his form has taken a dive since he and Hamilton collided in Barcelona last month Both Mercedes drivers retired from that race  while Rosberg was seventh in Monaco and fifth in Canada On the flip side  it is a positive in terms of the points but Nico is going to continue to push and I will continue to push  Hamilton made another poor start in Montreal  after an issue with the clutch  which allowed Ferraris Sebastian Vettel to grab the lead at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve while the Mercedes drivers again banged wheels While Rosberg went off  Hamilton was able to recover and his one stop strategy proved decisive Hamilton dismissed suggestions that Rosberg was feeling the pressure  responding   What would lead you to think he has been rattled  I dont get that sense  I think he is still pushing but we are starting to have cleaner weekends  Hamilton also sensed a growing belief among his mechanics  many of whom worked with Rosberg last year 
Germany may have won their opening Euro 2016 game against Ukraine 2 0 on Sunday  with talismanic captain Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring late  but the victory also highlighted the need for defensive repairs The world champions looked to be heading in the right direction when defender Shkodran Mustafi  starting in place of the injured Mats Hummels  headed them into the lead from a free kick  something they had worked on in the run up to the tournament However  instead of sitting back and relaxing  Germany coach Joachim Loew had to wait until stoppage time for his team to secure victory when Schweinsteiger netted just minutes after coming on as a substitute Group C rivals Ukraine sliced open Loew's makeshift rearguard time and again in the first half with Mustafi and Jerome Boateng failing to work well together Boateng did produce a spectacular goalline clearance but full backs Jonas Hector and Benedikt Hoewedes also struggled to contain the speed of wingers Andriy Yarmolenko and Yevhen Konoplyanka The German defence was always going to be problematic with Hoewedes and Boateng only recently back from long injury absences Hummels  Boateng's partner in the middle during their 2014 World Cup triumph in Brazil  is temporarily sidelined while fellow centre back Antonio Ruediger was ruled out of the Euros with torn knee ligaments Ukraine were unable to sustain the same tempo after the break but their display showed Germany they will need to raise their game against Poland on Thursday BETTER ORGANISED We had to make adjustments in defence   said Loew   We lost a lot of possession in the first half  In the second half we were better organised and had more control of the ball  Mustafi's stoppage time header back to keeper Manuel Neuer that almost gifted the Ukrainians a goal was indicative of the overall performance in defence  It was an open game  a flowing game   said Mustafi   We had a situation where we were open    it was a game we did not want  Germany will draw confidence from Schweinsteiger's never say die attitude  with the holding midfielder's presence crucial to the team's overall spirit Schweinsteiger has been injured for months  with his very participation in the Euros in doubt  and his goal could not have come at a better time to inspire the squad as they bid to win the competition for the fourth time  We know now that we have to raise our level and hopefully we will do it for Poland   said Neuer

Sri Lanka Cricket will lodge a complaint with the International Cricket Council  ICC  against an  unacceptable  reprieve for England batsman Alex Hales in the third and final test at Lord's  SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala has said Nuwan Pradeep clean bowled Hales  then on 58  in England's second innings on Sunday but it was adjudged a no ball by umpire Rod Tucker  even though replays suggested a fraction of the paceman's shoe was behind the popping crease Hales capitalised on the reprieve to score 94 before he was finally dismissed but his reprieve prompted the visitors to briefly unfurl a Sri Lankan flag from the balcony in a perceived mark of protest  The management on tour is very sad about that decision and it will be reported to the ICC   Sumathipala  who termed it  unacceptable   said Coach Graham Ford  who complained to match referee Andy Pycroft after Sunday's play  played down the unfurling of the flag by the team  who have already surrendered the three test series after crushing defeats in Leeds and Durham The SLC chief  however  saw it differently  The flag is a symbol   Sumathipala said   It is a mark to say we are not happy with the decision   It was unfurled  To show solidarity and fight back  Ford said Tucker had apologised for the mistake and the coach was of the view that front foot no ball calls should be taken out of the on field umpire's hand  It just seems strange that with the technology that is available you can get a line call wrong   Ford said  You'd think the best solution would be for the umpires to worry about what's going on down the other end and for technology to look after the line call  Meanwhile  England paceman James Anderson was reprimanded for  conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game  during the match  the ICC said in a statement Anderson was guilty of showing disrespect to umpire S Ravi  who had asked the paceman not to verbally engage with Sri Lankan batsman Rangana Herath during the visitors' first innings Sri Lanka resume Monday's final day on 32 for no loss  needing 330 more runs to salvage some pride in the series in which they have been thoroughly outplayed 
St  KITTS  Australia vice captain David Warner has a fractured left index finger  the team announced on Sunday Opening batsman Warner suffered the injury while fielding during Saturdays victory over South Africa in the triangular one day series in St Kitts  We will assess the situation over the coming days to see if the injury requires a surgical option but should that not be the case then David is likely to be available to return to play in somewhere between two and six weeks   team doctor Geoffrey Verrall said in a statement The final of the triangular contest  which also includes the host West Indies  will be played on June 26  which seems to rule Warner out for the rest of the series The injury comes as the left hander is in some of the best form of his career Warner was named man of the match on Saturday after completing his first ODI century outside Australia  a knock of 109 off 120 balls at the appropriately named Warner Park Just two weeks ago he captained Sunrisers Hyderabad to victory in the final of the Indian Premier League Warner is looking at the positives of his enforced absence after a busy stretch of cricket  Its obviously disappointing to be sidelined given the form Ive been in  but this  will give me the chance to freshen up and spend quality time with my family after an intense period of action  Australia lead the triangular series with two victories from three games <br/> They next meet West Indies in St Kitts on Monday 
Stand in centre back Shkodran Mustafi headed his first goal for Germany and Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in stoppage time as the world champions survived several scares to beat Ukraine 2 0 in their opening Euro 2016 Group C match on Sunday Mustafi  who started in the absence of regular centre back Mats Hummels  rifled home a header after 19 minutes to give Germany the lead  which was not extended until Schweinsteiger  a 90th minute substitute  swept home from close range Germany  bidding for a fourth Euro triumph but first since 1996  dominated possession  but also relied on three top saves from keeper Manuel Neuer and a goal line clearance by Jerome Boateng to come out on top Ukraine  playing in their second European championship  harried and hustled their opponents and their tight defence offered few clear sights of goal to the Germans Yet lone striker Roman Zozulya was unable to offer much threat  except at the very start and in the closing stages as Ukraine pushed on in search of an equaliser In a breakneck first half  Ukraine's Yevhen Konoplyanka forced Germany keeper Neuer to make a flying save in the fourth minute before the Germans steadily took control  with Toni Kroos orchestrating most of their attacks It was from his free kick  that Mustafi  who last featured for Germany in March and only made the side because Hummels was recovering from a muscle injury  leapt behind Serhiy Sydorchuk to power in a header Ten minutes later Sami Khedira had the chance to double Germany's lead as Kroos floated a ball beyond the defence  but he shot straight at the keeper By then though  the Ukrainians had woken up and  driving their full backs higher up the pitch  forced Neuer to punch over a strong header from Yevhen Khacheridi Boateng was then forced into a dramatic clearance  having first lost the ball before hacking it clear while back pedalling into the net  Lone striker Zozulya also had an effort disallowed for offside as Germany hung on until halftime Ukraine posed less of a threat in the second half  relying on hopeful long balls forward  while their keeper Andriy Pyatov was forced into action to save a long range effort from Khedira  a low drive from Thomas Mueller and from Mesut Ozil  when he was through on goal Germany suffered one final fright when Mustafi headed back over Neuer's head  leaving the goalkeeper to scramble back towards his own net  while appearing to body check substitute striker Yevhen Seleznyov in the process Then  in the final seconds  with Ukraine pushing up  Germany countered and Schweinsteiger slammed in an Ozil cross to score The result extended Germany's unbeaten run against Ukraine to six matches and maintained their record of never having lost their opening match in a European Championship Germany will play joint group leaders Poland at the Stade de France on Thursday  when Ukraine take on Northern Ireland in Lyon Several hours before the match  German and Ukrainian supporters scuffled briefly in the centre of Lille  though police quickly brought the situation under control 
Sri Lanka coach Graham Ford called for all no ball decisions to be taken by the third umpire as his side reacted to an incorrect call in the third Test against England with an extraordinary flag protest at Lords on Sunday At stumps  Sri Lanka were 32 without loss in their second innings  needing a further 330 runs on Mondays fifth and final day to reach an imposing victory target of 362 More realistically  their goal was to prevent England  already 2 0 up in the three match series  taking the 10 wickets they needed to complete a whitewash But England captain Alastair Cook  49 not out batting down the order after a knee injury suffered while fielding  may not have been able to declare his sides second innings on 233 for seven had a few close calls Sunday gone Sri Lankas way instead Significantly  Sri Lanka thought they had Alex Hales    who went on to make 94    out for 58 when he was bowled by Nuwan Pradeep  But Australian umpire Rod Tucker had already called a no ball  Replays suggested Pradeeps front foot may have been behind the crease but fielding teams are unable to challenge a no ball call by an umpire and Hales survived In February  a similar incident saw Australias Adam Voges make 239 in a Test against New Zealand in Wellington after being reprieved on seven following an incorrectly called no ball by English umpire Richard Illingworth Under International Cricket Council regulations  the third umpire is powerless to intervene in such situations There are proposals on the table to prevent a repeat of these types of incidents and Ford said   The ICC have to look at it  It seems strange with the technology available that you can still get a line call wrong   the South African added  The best solution is for the umpires to worry about whats happening down the other end and let technology look after the line call   The game has a funny way of kicking you when you are down  That was a kick we didnt need  The Sri Lanka management reacted to Haless reprieve by draping the national over the tourists dressing room balcony for some 45 minutes Ford said this wasnt so much a protest as a gesture of solidarity with the players out on the middle  At that stage we felt the boys were fighting hard and we wanted to show our support from the dressing room to boost their morale   only for us to find out thats not the done thing and we had to take it down   said Ford He added that Tucker had apologised to Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews for his mistake  He got the news from the third umpire and he apologised to Angelo  It was very good of him to have done that and we move on  Hales  for all his good fortune Sunday  was still left waiting for a maiden Test hundred The Nottinghamshire opener  out for 86 and 83 in the first two Tests  got closer still on Sunday before he was lbw to medium pacer Mathews Somewhat ironically  in view of Sri Lankas earlier protest  Hales sought a review of the decision only for DRS to find in the tourists favour on this occasion  Its disappointing again to come so close   said Hales  whose 126 ball innings included 10 fours and a six  But it was pretty decent delivery and I had my fair share of luck    bowled off a no ball  umpires calls and edges    I guess the luck ran out  
Substitute Raul Riudiaz's hotly disputed goal earned Peru a shock 1 0 win over Brazil in Foxborough  Massachusetts on Sunday  the defeat knocking the five times world champions out the Copa America at the group stage The Peruvian forward appeared to use his hand to score from close range with 16 minutes remaining and after a long delay while the referee consulted with his assistant while taking advice through an earpiece  he allowed the goal to stand Television pictures showed Ruidiaz grinning after the goal had been awarded but the Brazilian players were apoplectic with rage at a decision that sent them tumbling out of the tournament before the knockout stages for the first time since 1987  We saw that the ball hit his hand but you can't complain   Brazil centre half Miranda told reporters    The referee  said he discussed it with four officials and that they didn't see the handball  Brazil tried from the first minute to score but the ball didn't want to go in unfortunately  and that's football  If you don't score you pay for it  The result lifted Peru to the top of Group B and eliminated Brazil  who dropped down to third place behind Ecuador in the tournament being played in the United States to celebrate the centenary of governing body CONMEBOL and the Copa America Following the conclusion of the first two groups in the 16 team competition  Peru will play Colombia in the quarter finals in New Jersey on Friday  while the host nation will take on Ecuador in Seattle a day earlier Mexico  Venezuela and Argentina have already qualified from the other two groups with a match to play with either Chile or Panama joining them in the quarter finals pending the result of their showdown on Tuesday MISSED OPPORTUNITYThe loss was a harsh one for Brazil  who knew a draw would have been enough to see them advance and were generally the better team without ever really threatening the Peruvian goal Peru upped the tempo after a lacklustre first half and the controversial decider came after 74 minutes when Andy Polo whipped in a low cross that fell just behind the onrushing Ruidiaz inside the six yard box The Universitario player appeared to handle the ball into the net to the immediate anger of the Brazilian players  who surrounded the Uruguayan referee along with several Peruvians before the official opted to give the goal after a long delay Elias then missed a golden opportunity to equalise for Brazil in injury time but he failed to connect properly with only the goalkeeper to beat The result came just hours after Ecuador hammered a hapless Haiti 4 0 to guarantee their quarter final berth Enner Valencia opened the scoring after 10 minutes and Jaime Ayovi doubled Ecuador's advantage nine minutes later after a swift counter attack Christian Noboa made it 3 0 with a well placed shot after 56 minutes before Antonio Valencia tapped home the fourth after another break on 77 minutes The result left Haiti  who were competing in the competition for the first time  bottom of the group on no points and a goal difference of minus 11

Ireland can take encouragement from a 1 1 draw in their Euro 2016 Group E opener on Monday but the result was a cause of great concern for Sweden whose mediocrity contrasted starkly with their opponents' desire Ireland were the better team and Sweden were fortunate to grab an equaliser when Irish defender Ciaran Clark headed a cross into his own goal after Wes Hoolahan had opened the scoring with a splendid strike early in the second half It was another misfortune for Ireland at the Stade de France  where they were playing for the first time since Thierry Henry's infamous handball for France led to a goal that crushed the 2010 World Cup qualifying dreams of the Irish in a playoff Monday's match was probably the one the Irish and Swedes had targeted for a win in a section that also features traditional European force Italy and a talented Belgium side Martin O'Neill's Boys in Green  however  can be more optimistic than Erik Hamren's Blue Yellows  who did not manage a single shot on target despite the efforts of talisman Zlatan Ibrahimovic  who was kept fairly quiet by Ireland's defence  We have two very  very tough matches coming against two sides that are very classy   said O'Neill  But if I can take anything from the performance today  it was that the players looked accomplished  We have the desire but the players are growing into international football  Both teams were backed by hordes of fans and the yellow and green armies brought a festive touch to the Stade de France  in sharp contrast with the violence that has marred the tournament O'Neill's side showed a real desire to win  making two attacking substitutions after Sweden's equaliser  while the Scandinavians looked slow and toothless until Ireland took a deserved lead three minutes after the break Hoolahan struck a superb half volley into the net from Seamus Coleman's perfect cross into the area triggering a roar rarely heard in the usually subdued Stade de France MATCH WINNING CHANCEThat acted as a wake up call for Sweden  who were relying on their enigmatic 34 year old captain Ibrahimovic  I came like a king  left like a legend   Ibrahimovic quipped as he left Paris St Germain at the end of last season after helping them win a second straight domestic treble He was certainly neither when he returned to Paris on Monday In the first half  Ibrahimovic looked lost on a pitch where which he won two French Cup and two League Cup trophies and  while he produced the cross that led to Ireland's own goal  the striker failed to convert a chance in the closing stages In the 71st minute  Ibrahimovic made a rare break down the left flank into the area and his cross was headed into his own goal by the unfortunate Clark Twelve minutes later  however  Ibrahimovic just failed to connect as Martin Olsson's cross whizzed in front of him  missing the chance to score an almost certain winner albeit undeserved  The feeling right now is disappointment rather than coming back for a draw   said Hamren  For the first 50 minutes Ireland were better  Credit to Ireland  Our attack was really bad in the first half  They were able to close us down We didnt lose but Im disappointed because we didnt play the way we should have done  Ibrahimovic added   I tried but I can do much better  
Basseterre  Saint Kitts and Nevis  Marlon Samuels produced his best batting effort in One Day International cricket against Australia to lead the West Indies to a six wicket victory in the fifth match of the Tri Nation series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday Set a challenging target after Usman Khawajas 98 and supporting half centuries from skipper Steve Smith  74  and George Bailey  55  lifted the visitors to 265 for seven batting first  the enigmatic Samuels stroked 92 to ensure that the target was reached with 20 deliveries to spare The Jamaican right hander made an important deposit on a significant overdraft against the World Cup holders  his innings spanning 87 deliveries and decorated with eight fours and four sixes    the last three of which came off consecutive balls from leg spinner Adam Zampa over long off In keeping with his mercurial nature  he was run out off the very next delivery to have the West Indies at 240 for four in the 41st over  Two more wickets fell to Nathan Coulter Nile with the score at 254 before Kieron Pollard and Carlos Brathwaite formalised victory in the 46th over Denesh Ramdin also played a key role in the run chase  He supported Samuels in a 73 run fourth wicket stand and continued to play sensibly following the demise of his senior partner before being bowled by Coulter Nile for 29 Victory pulled the West Indies within a point of leaders Australia in the three team standings  West Indies next play South Africa on Wednesday at the same venue Samuels had joined Darren Bravo at the crease following a rollicking opening stand of 74 in ten overs before all rounder James Faulker removed Fletcher for 27 while Zampa trapped Charles in front for 48 Bravo and Samuels then steadied the West Indies chase  keeping them well on course in an 82 run third wicket partnership that was broken when Zampa removed Bravo for 39 via at bat pad catch that lobbed comfortably to wicketkeeper Matthew Wade Earlier  Khawajas promotion to open the batting in the absence of the injured David Warner paid immediate dividends He lost Aaron Finch in the very first over to West Indies captain Jason Holder but then featured in a 170 run second wicket partnership with Smith  who overcame the nagging discomfort of a right leg injury to help put his team in a commanding position by the time he departed in the 35th over  the victim of a clever change of pace from all rounder Carlos Brathwaite Khawaja was on the verge of a maiden ODI hundred but  becalmed in the nineties  he took on the challenge of a third run for his third wicket partner  Bailey  and was found short of his ground by Jerome Taylors return from the boundary to stand in wicketkeeper Fletcher  His innings occupied 123 deliveries and was embellished by three sixes and four fours Fletchers position behind the stumps was the result of an injury to Ramdin who fell heavily on his right shoulder when attempting to effect a run out a few overs earlier  He returned for the final overs  taking two catches to dismiss Travis Head and Bailey off Pollard Head earned his selection after Warner was ruled out of the rest of the tournament with a broken finger sustained against South Africa on Saturday  
Rain ensured England and Sri Lanka drew the third Test at Lords on Monday  a result that saw England win the three match series 2 0 Sri Lanka set 362 to win  finished on 78 for one after rain  which had prevented any play before lunch on the final day  finally saw the umpires abandon the match as a draw at 5 12 pm local time  1612 GMT  Dimuth Karunaratne was 37 not out and Kusal Mendis 17 not out Mondays result left Sri Lanka still searching for their first Test win at Lords  having now drawn six and lost two of their longest format clashes at the home of cricket Only 22 balls were possible between lunch and tea after rain washed out Mondays first session  but that was long enough for Sri Lanka to lose opener Kaushal Silva Sri Lanka resumed Monday on 32 without loss  Karunaratne was 19 not out and Silva unbeaten on 12 Mondays first over saw Silva edge Broad just short of England captain Alastair Cook at first slip  But Anderson  Englands all time leading Test wicket taker  struck when Silva  padding up after failing to pick an inswinger going against the Lords slipe  was lbw for 16 Silva reviewed but to no avail  with Sri Lanka 45 for one  No sooner had Silva been dismissed than the umpires took the players off the field after just 18 minutes play  But the weather relented for play to resume after tea  Even though the floodlights were on  there was now a risk the match might be halted for bad light Bairstows Test best 167 not out and 85 from Cook were the major contributions to Englands first innings 416  Sri Lanka could only manage 288 in reply  despite fifties from Karunaratne and Silva Englands second innings 233 for seven declared saw Alex Hales again fall short of a maiden Test century with 94    his third fifty of a series where the opener had twice been dismissed in the 80s Sri Lanka continue their tour with two one day internationals against Ireland in Dublin on Thursday and Saturday  They then face England in the first at Nottinghams Trent Bridge in the first of five one dayers on June 21 Mondays draw meant England lead the inaugural Super Series against Sri Lanka by 10 points to two  But with two points on offer for a win in each of the six white ball fixtures    five ODIs and a lone Twenty20    Sri Lanka can still win the multi format Super Series

Adam Szalai and Zoltan Stieber scored second half goals as Hungary stunned highly fancied Austria 2 0 in their Group F opener in Bordeaux on Tuesday  Jun 14  Austria  tipped as tournament dark horses  dominated the opening period but Szalai fired Hungary ahead on 62 minutes with Stieber wrapping up a shock victory over their old rivals late on in the 138th meeting between the sides Aleksandar Dragovic was sent off for Austria shortly after Szalai ended an 18 month goal drought as Hungary made a triumphant return to a major tournament having last featured at the 1986 World Cup Hungary goalkeeper Gabor Kiraly kept a clean sheet as he became the first 40 year old to feature at the European Championship  surpassing Germany's Lothar Matthaus as the oldest player in tournament history Austria captain Christian Fuchs and winger Martin Harnik were the only two survivors from the country's debut campaign eight years ago named in Marcel Koller's starting line up However  they were inches away from the perfect start when Bayern Munich star David Alaba went agonisingly close to justifying his billing as one of the potential stars of the tournament when his dipping left footed strike from outside the area crashed against the post The versatile Alaba  operating in his customary central midfield with Austria  soon fired another warning to Hungary with a first time strike at Kiraly after a threaded pass through from Marko Arnautovic Szalai miscued a header from a Balazs Dzsudzsak free kick in a rare opening for Hungary  while Kiraly showed his reflexes remain sharp despite his advancing years to claw behind a low strike from Zlatko Junuzovic Arnautovic then slid a dangerous low ball across the face of goal as Austria continued to threaten  but Harnik lost his footing as he tried to slide home at the far post Hungary captain Dzsudzsak wasted arguably the best chance of the opening 45 minutes  though  as he screwed his shot wide of goal after he was picked out by Laszlo Kleinheisler on the right hand side of the penalty area Dzsudzsak again took aim 10 minutes into the second period  his stinging 30 yard shot forcing Austria keeper Robert Almer to fist the punch behind for a corner And Hungary grabbed a surprise lead just beyond the hour when Kleinheisler slipped in Szalai  who was played onside by Fuchs  with the powerful striker poking the ball underneath Almer for his first goal at any level since December 2014 Austria appeared to have levelled when Martin Hinteregger rifled in from the edge of the area  but referee Clement Turpin disallowed the goal for a foul on Tamas Kadar with Dragovic dismissed for a second booking And Stieber triggered delirious celebrations when he raced from just inside the Austria half to beat Almer three minutes from time with a sublime chip as Hungary completed a stunning upset for their first European Championship win since 1964 
Argentina maintained their 100 percent record at the Copa America Centenario on Tuesday with a 3 0 victory over hapless Bolivia The tournament favorites  already assured of a quarter final berth after wins over Chile and Panama  wrapped up their Group D campaign with an easy win at Seattles CenturyLink Field The victory sees Argentina reach the last eight as group winners  handing them what in theory should be a straightforward assignment against Venezuela in Foxborough on Saturday The two time world champions are determined to end a 23 year wait for a major title after suffering agonizing defeats in the finals of the 2014 World Cup and last years Copa America On current form few would bet against the South American giants  who could afford to omit Lionel Messi from their starting line up following his hat trick display against Panama The match was effectively settled within the first quarter of an hour  with Tottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela opening the scoring with a deflected free kick in the 13th minute Two minutes later China based forward Ezequiel Lavezzi marked his comeback from injury with a goal  volleying home from close range after Gonzalo Higuains downward header Central defender Victor Cuesta made it 3 0 just after the half hour  diverting home Lavezzis low cross in the 32nd minute Argentina manager Gerardo Martino brought on Messi at half time  and a one sided second half soon became a question of when or if the Barcelona superstar could grab a 54th international goal to equal Gabriel Batistutas longstanding scoring record However despite Argentinas dominance  Messi was unable to add to his teams tally  his best chance coming with a 25 yard curling freekick which flew just wide of the goal

Day night test is the future of cricket's longest format but the boards should not rush it  according to New Zealand pace great Richard Hadlee Australia played the first day night test against New Zealand at Adelaide Oval last November and have agreed another flood lit match with South Africa at the same venue during the home summer The concept has found ready takers in south Asia with India trialling pink balls and Pakistan agreeing to play a floodlit test in Brisbane in December  You try; it is the game of the future  Probably one test in a series is fair enough   Hadlee told reporters in Mumbai  I think most people like to see the traditional format during the day  The durability of the pink kookaburra ball and the dew factor in India have raised doubts about the future of a floodlit test in the country Hadlee said the players must get ample practice before such a contest  It is important for the players to have practice games; you cannot ask them to go out there and ask them to play a day night game against the pink ball  It is unrealistic in professional environment era  That needs to be tried and tested  so players can get some confidence   Conditions are different all around the world  so we don't really know how the pink ball is going to work here in India and that's why players need to have those practice games   he added

The United States survived a late onslaught to beat Ecuador 2 1 and advance to the semi finals of the Copa America for the first time since 1995 after a pulsating and sometime fractious match in Seattle on Thursday Clint Dempsey and Gyasi Zardes scored for the U S  either side of half time and Michael Arroyo got one back for Ecuador in a game that saw one player from each side sent off and the Ecuador coach banished to the stands Ecuador came into the game more after Antonio Valencia and Jermaine Jones were shown red cards in the 51st minute but the hosts prevailed to set up a semi final against either Argentina or Venezuela in Houston next Tuesday  We've come so far now and now we get even hungrier for the next step   said U S  coach Jurgen Klinsmann  The team performance was outstanding  They were helping each other all over the field  Dempsey  a striker who plays for local club Seattle Sounders  got the opener for the U S  after 21 minutes when he rose to head home a deft cross from Jones He almost got a second four minutes later but his angled drive was well saved and Alejandro Bedoya should have done better when Dempsey's pass left him with a shot on goal that Alexander Dominguez got down well to smother At the other end  Brad Guzan did well to turn an Enner Valencia shot round the post as he honed in on goal Then came the dismissals with Antonio Valencia sent off for a second yellow after hacking down Bedoya and his fellow midfielder Jones harshly shown a straight red for raising his hand in the ensuing scuffle Zardes doubled the home side's lead when he poked home from inches out after Dempsey had beaten the goalie but the goal roused Ecuador and they took control of the game Enner Valencia should have scored at least twice from close range headers but it was Arroyo who cut the lead after 73 minutes when he found the net with a low drive from the edge of the box after the defence had given him too much space The South Americans threw everything at the hosts in the final quarter but they could not find a second goal and the U S  advanced to the last four
